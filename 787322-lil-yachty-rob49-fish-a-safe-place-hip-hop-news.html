Ever since he got a place on <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Travis Scott</a>'s UTOPIA, Rob has gone on to collaborate with some of the best.

According to HipHopDX, Lil Boat roasted Rob by saying he "kinda look[s] like a fish." The "TOPIA TWINS" rapper gave his interviewer an opening to make a joke when he asked, "How old I look?" That is when Yachty went in for the kill, "He kinda look like… a Avatar." Rob threatened him back, saying, "I’ll bust y’all a** in here. I’m from New Orleans."
