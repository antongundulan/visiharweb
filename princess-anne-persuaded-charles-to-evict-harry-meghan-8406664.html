Scobie wrote that the Princess Royal was “at the forefront of the supporters of the firm approach” to evict them, while Prince Edward, on the other hand, was "uneasy" about the Palace's decision. In the end, Harry and Meghan were sent a letter from Sir Michael John Stevens, the Keeper of the Privy Purse, urging them to hand back the keys to the cottage, which was a wedding gift from the late Queen Elizabeth and had recently undergone a $3 million renovation.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Scobie, the Sussexes were "shocked" by the news, prompting Harry to call Charles about his decision. During the heated phone call, Harry reportedly asked his father: "Don't you want to see your grandchildren?" His question was met with silence by Charles, who later promised his son that his family would always have "somewhere" to stay when they visited the U.K.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Scobie shared his own feelings about the unprecedented move by Charles, writing: “Staying mum about Harry’s accusations and remaining publicly unconcerned for his son’s well-being while ending his family’s lease on a safe U.K. residence was not a decisive action by a resolute King; it was a cheap shot from a wounded father bound by an institutional system that is often intolerant of human emotion.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57z6ugp5uVqMBurc2nnGaolafAtq3Dnptmm5iWv62x0marqGWVq7akwIyhmKuqqWK6prPHmqVmcGRlg3eCkw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./755300-playboi-carti-pic-son-iggy-azalea.html><span>←</span><span>Playboi Carti Shares Pic Of His Son With Iggy Azalea</span></a>
