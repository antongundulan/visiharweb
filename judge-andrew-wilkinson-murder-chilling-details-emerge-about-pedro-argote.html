His oldest daughter made similar claims, saying Argote was “watching my every move” through cameras. The women said Argote was abusive, beating them with “whatever [object] he had close by.” Before ruling Argote was to have no contact with his family, Wilkinson called him “abusive in multiple ways.” Argote, who fled after the alleged murder, remains at-large.</p><a class=ReadItAtLink href=# rel=noreferrer><span>Read it at </span><span class=ReadItAtLink__name>Associated Press</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfn8Kls8RmmKecoprEbsPIpaKipqOku2651KubnqpdmLWquMuipaBllJrBorXLrGSepZWntKZ5wJumrqxdpbKlvs5mmKufn6my</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./busy-philipps-pole-dancing-underwear-fans-react.html><span>←</span><span>Busy Philipps pole dancing in her underwear has to be seen to be believed</span></a>
