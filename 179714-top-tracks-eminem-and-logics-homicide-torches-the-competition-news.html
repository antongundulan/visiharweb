Prior to this week, he'd never appeared on any of our weekly top tens. Mozzy is second with two to his name. New tracks barely missing out on spots this week include YG, Jon Z, and Tyga's "Go Loko" (#11), Yung Nudy, Pi'erre Bourne, and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Uzi Vert</a>'s "Extendo" (#12), Blueface's "Stop Cappin" (#13), and Schoolboy Q and 6LACK's "Drunk" (#16).&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This past Friday, PnB Rock shared his new album&nbsp;TrapStar Turnt PopStar. Included on there is a collaboration with the late XXXTentacion, with whom PnB says he recorded "a few songs" before the late rapper was murdered last year. "Middle Child"— no relation to the J. Cole hit— debuts at #10.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">At least on HNHH,&nbsp;diss songs&nbsp;get way more play than artists' "regular" songs. While it's cool to see some under-the-radar rappers get some rare shine, it's also disheartening when an artist who's deserved the shine from day one, like Mozzy, only gets recognition for drama. "Chill Phillipe," one of his offerings in beef with Philthy Rich,&nbsp;is up 45 places in its second week out, going from #54 to #9.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Unlike Mozzy, who hasn't appeared on our charts because he's still a bit underrated, Philthy Rich hasn't appeared on our charts because his heyday mostly came before we even had a weekly Top Tracks feature. The Bay Area mainstay lept into it with Mozzy, and now he's seeing a boom in views. "Big 59" debuts at #8.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Never one to ignore a trend, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Diplo</a> announced his plans to make a country-influenced album just after <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Nas X</a>'s crossover record hit #1 on the charts. Diplo being Diplo, he also had to remix the damn thing for himself. His version of the Billy Ray Cyrus-featuring remix of "Old Town Road" debuts at #7.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The most recent of&nbsp;Philthy Rich's Mozzy shots&nbsp;on this chart, "Troublesome 59" takes its name and beat from 2pac's "Troublesome 96." It debuts at #6.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">After "Big 59" and "Troublesome 59," Mozzy fired back with "Killdrummy," his latest word on the ongoing matter between him and Philthy Rich.

His last track was a stoner anthem that featured Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y, his latest pairs him up with longtime pal Cam'ron, and on top of all that, the bulk of the new album is produced by the Heatmakerz. In its second week out, "Mama I Made It" is up four places from #8 to #4.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The song that ignited a flurry of diss tracks. After Mozzy signed Philthy Rich's longtime rival Messy Marv to a subsidiary deal, Philthy lashed out with "Don't Forget," and the rest as they say, is history. In its second week out, "Don't Forget" is up 32 places from #35 to #3.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Joyner Lucas</a> has spent the bulk of the last two years making viral videos, freestyling over hits by rappers he hates, and working on a collaboration album with Chris Brown that keeps getting pushed back.

"Devil's Work," the lead single from the forthcoming&nbsp;ADHD, debuts at #2,&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">and has incited a response from Tomi Lahren.&nbsp;</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Logic clearly needed a momentum-swinger after he upended his own rollout for&nbsp;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&nbsp;with pop-rock departure&nbsp;Supermarket. Now back on track for his upcoming rappity-rap album, he unleashed a trump card in the form of an Eminem duet.
