The <a href=#>former "SNL" comedian</a> and his wife shared a heart-wrenching <a href=#>post on social media</a>, revealing Dex's cause of death in a joint statement. They wrote, "Last night we suffered a terrible tragedy. Our beloved son, Dex, died of an accidental overdose. He was 32 years old." Although Dana and Paula shared that their <a href=#>son died of an "accidental overdose,"</a> no official cause of death has been released as authorities are still waiting for toxicology reports to come back from the autopsy, per <a href=#>TMZ</a>.</p><p>The couple continued to honor their eldest son by sharing their admiration for Dex. They wrote, "Dex packed a lot into those 32 years. He was extremely talented at so many things — music, art, filmmaking, comedy — and pursued all of them passionately." Dana and Paula shared that Dex "loved life," and deeply loved those around him. From family and friends to his girlfriend, Kaylee, he cared about each one of them so deeply. The couple continued, "Dex was a beautiful person. His handmade birthday cards are a treasure. We will miss him forever." Dana and Paula ended their statement by sharing their love for those struggling and those affected by addiction.&nbsp;</p><p>If you or anyone you know is struggling with addiction issues, help is available.
