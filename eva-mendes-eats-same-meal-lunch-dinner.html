The mum-of-two has admitted she eats the exact same meal for lunch and dinner every day, but insists she doesn't get bored with her diet routine. "I don't get bored with food," the actress told magazine. "I try to think about it as fuel for my body."</p><p id=ehHhwGNt4wfo><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY: Eva Mendes on why she wasn't with Ryan Gosling during awards season</a></p><p id=exC3i1Ll88XB data-wc=111>One of Eva's favourite foods for fuel is eggs. "I think they’re like magic - you can do so much with them," she said. "I mostly keep it simple and have scrambled eggs and a piece of Ezekiel toast for breakfast." However she admits she does have a weakness for muffins and pastries. "But if somebody brings over muffins or some other kind of delicious treat, I'll eat that with my coffee instead. It's a terrible way to begin my day, though. I really regret it later, because I just don't have as much energy. I find that when I start out with the right source of protein, it definitely helps."</p><p style=text-align:center id=eJ8tK6pO6ywX><span><strong></strong></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/593f9046443d-eva-mendes-fashion-launch-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e0fdhDw1_YlZ data-wc=12><strong>Eva Mendes admitted she eats the same thing for lunch and dinner</strong></p><p id=elab637UShrR data-wc=67>The actress also admitted she tends to eat the same thing for lunch and dinner, too. Eva explained: "I grew up eating rice and beans, so I want some kind of grain in every meal. For lunch, I usually have salmon and rice or quinoa, and I try to include a salad. I'll eat the same thing for dinner. I’m a creature of habit in that way."</p><p id=eK4bf7AH_ny3><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Read more about celebrity diets here</a></p><p id=e0xIfQwjLK8F data-wc=60>Eva has two daughters, Esmeralda Amada, two, and 11-month-old Amada Lee with her boyfriend Ryan Gosling, so says her meals typically have to be quick and easy to make. "What I am looking forward to is the time when dinner becomes a sit-down situation again," Eva said. "Right now I’m in survival mode with two babies, eating on the go."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f1549d2cea94-eva-mendes-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=elOCs88Y9-TH data-wc=11><strong>The actress does interval training to balance out her sugar cravings</strong></p><p id=eMKC4TYyKmES data-wc=117>While her diet is mostly healthy and packed with protein, wholegrains and vegetables, Eva confessed she does struggle with sugar cravings after meals, which she tries to balance with interval training. "Sweets are my thing. It's ongoing, and I have to manage my sugar cravings constantly," the 43-year-old said. "I've gotten used to having something sweet after every meal, so I'm always bartering with myself: No, no, I can’t have that after dinner, but maybe I can have it after lunch instead. The kid in me thinks, I work out, so I can support my sugar habit. I know that's not a very wise thing to say, but I really do feel like I'm working it off!"</p><p id=e61szkDN8KOl data-wc=7><strong>Feeling inspired?
