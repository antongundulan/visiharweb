Controversial psychologist and writer, Dr Jordan Peterson, 59, has quit Twitter after his tweets about plus-sized model Yumi Nu led to a fierce backlash.
On Tuesday night, Peterson shared his thoughts on Nu's Sports Illustrated cover, saying he didn't find the 25-year-old attractive.

And tell me you believe that such images are not conscious and cynical manipulation by the oh-so virtuous politically correct," he tweeted.</p><p>Nu's fans immediately came to her defence. Some called the writer out for his hypocrisy, throwing a few jabs at Peterson's appearance, while others retweeted his tweet using photos of Peterson himself.</p><p>"I'm not sure what's worse, that a man publicly shames a woman he doesn't find attractive (while wanting to leave a site he calls 'vicious'), calls it 'authoritarian tolerance' when others find her attractive, or that he lures men into believing his words or ideas have validity," one commenter wrote.</p><p>"Sheesh.

He claimed the "endless flood of vicious insult is really not something that can be experienced anywhere else", and would continue communicating with his fans through articles or videos.</p><p>"So I told my staff to change my password, to keep me from temptation, and am departing once again," he tweeted.</p><p>"If I have something to say I'll write an article or make a video. If the issue is not important enough to justify that then perhaps it would be best to just let it go."</p><p>However, Peterson appears to be continuing to use Twitter. Since his "bye for now" tweet, the 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos author has shared at least 27 tweets. His latest post is from 5am today in which he thanked his supporters for reaching 5 million subscribers.</p><p>Peterson is no stranger to controversy. He's been critiqued for his controversial claims, which include committing to an all-meat diet to cure benzodiazepine withdrawal and discounting climate change.</p><p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, the divisive figure also slammed Australia's coronavirus management strategy, accusing us of operating under a "police state".</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"Australians (and perhaps all in the west): are you being asked to choose between the dangers of a police state vs the dangers of Covid?" his shared in a tweet.</p><p>"I would certainly prefer the relatively low risk of the latter to the increasingly unpleasant certainty of the former."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmpaGWmsC1xcueZqOnopmur3nBZqeerJWnwLC6jKqsoqyjYsG4tdOtnKtlkZvBpr6MnKampZWjwbR5zqdkqaSlqHq0tdmem2aln5myrXnYrqSiZZ6qfJR%2Froxpa35mf5SToqaDeHyPd2qjlX%2BSh2l6Zw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jerome-ford-injury-update-what-happened-to-jerome-ford.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Jerome Ford Injury Update What Happened To Jerome Ford?</span></a>
