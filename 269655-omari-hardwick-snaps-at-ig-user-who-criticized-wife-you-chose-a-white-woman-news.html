As I stated… it is a rhetorical question we are all in the process of," the actor replied. "Whether that process is on the questioning side or the asking side. I will never answer that question from a person who&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">proves my point in asking it</a> with your disgraceful comment. You know nooothing about Jae nor my kids. I would NEVER disrespect your significant other or your kids. So watch your mouth in disrespecting mine a). b) This entire post of course consistent with me…proves how much i value black people, black women, black men, mySELF. A person’s life/journey mate (which if done right… has god in that choice equally) has nothing to do with that person’s value of themselves & the people that person’s culture/race.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He added, "Meanwhile....i know not to ever send anyone i care about to you for your craft used in being a nurse. And I see you follow me. So lemme add....i equally don't trust sh*t you say. So we're even. Yet sooo not. Please unfollow me."
