She alleges her profit participation of 10 percent of modified adjusted gross was improperly reduced by 20th through various tactics, including lowering it to 7.5 percent because she left the show as its second season was getting started and double-deducting other paricipations when calculating Gibson’s share.</p><p>Gibson claims that 20th paid her an advance against profits in 2008 but that in January 2010 additional payments became due. This isn’t the first time Gibson has sued 20th. Her lawsuit over an audit period that ended in 2006 is currently on appeal.</p><p class=MsoNormal>She claims she’s owed at least $1.1 million in damages from the improper profit calculation.</p><p class=MsoNormal>“Ms Gibson’s complaint, like the one she filed previously, lacks merit and includes claims she previously lost on in court,” a 20th TV rep tells THR in a statement. “We anticipate a similar outcome in this case.”</p><p>The suit, filed by Los Angeles attorney <strong>Richard Ross</strong>, alleges causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraud.</p><p>Email: Matthew.Belloni@thr.com<br>Twitter: @THRMattBelloni</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmq52SlnqiuMuiqqimXZy2o7%2FOp2RrbWVlhnd7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./raquel-leviss-ethnicity-what-is-raquel-levisss-ethnicity-html.html><span>←</span><span>Raquel Leviss Ethnicity, What is Raquel Levisss Ethnicity?</span></a>
