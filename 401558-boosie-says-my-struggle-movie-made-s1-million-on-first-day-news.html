Revealing that he did not pay for anything while working in Baton Rouge, Boosie said he was owed a couple favors and cashed in those favors to secure a couple filming locations.&nbsp;</p><p>The Louisiana native also explained that he did not "release the film&nbsp;hrough a major film company because he would've been stripped of his ownership and paid a relatively low fee," but did say that he had a comedy coming out on Christmas day and plans to launch his own version of Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p>Boosie's most recent foray into film and movies with&nbsp;My Struggle was a big one. With YFN Lucci, Mo3 and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Quando Rondo</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel>all appearing in the trailer for the film,</a> it was clear the "Wipe Me Down" rapper was trying to capture the realities of his time in the streets and the rap game.&nbsp;</p><p>Known for having&nbsp;<a href=# rel>something to say about anything and everything,</a>&nbsp;My Struggle and the ensuing interview with&nbsp;VladTV has been an interesting window into a much more refined version of Boosie and,&nbsp;<a href=# rel>despite losing his IG page again,</a> it will be interesting to see if the plans for a Christmas comedy and revamped version of Netflix come to fruition.</p><p>Check out Boosie saying&nbsp;My Struggle&nbsp;made a million in profits below and let us know in the comments if you've watched or plan to watch Boosie's movie.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkZX52gZdmmaino56ybr%2FAsqpmpaliwLW%2B1KCepZ1dory3tcRmpJqclWLAcnnMoqOloZ%2BjerC6jJ%2Bgq6ukYrGixYynnLCr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bill-duke-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Bill Duke Net Worth 2024</span></a>
