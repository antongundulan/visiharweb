If you're a fan of country music, then you likely know that he's a successful singer. You might also know that he's faced controversy and even found himself <a href=#>apologizing to fans</a>. Beyond that, do you think you'd be able to fill others in on the meanings behind some of his popular songs? For instance, there's <a href=#>"Does To Me"</a> and <a href=#>"Even Though I'm Leaving"</a> as well as <a href=#>"Better Together"</a> and <a href=#>"Behind Forever After All."</a> Of course, there's also <a href=#>"Lovin' On You."</a></p><p dir=ltr>"I like a bobber on the water / Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in / I like a Friday night slow ride / Brooks & Dunn B-side / ... I like a strong shot of whiskey / The way a Marlboro hits me / Some broken-in cowboy boots," Combs sings in the first verse in the song from his 2019 "What You See Is What You Get" album, per&nbsp;<a href=#>Genius</a>. In the second verse, he adds, "I like a sunrise, duck blind / Birdie on a par 5 / Miller Lite before noon / I like a two-door old Ford / Wood board back porch / Three chords and the truth."</p><p dir=ltr>What do all of those things have in common? Well, they're clearly a list of the things and experiences that Combs enjoys. However, even these things can't seem to compare to something else that he loves. Read on to find out what — or rather, who — that might be and how he really feels about them!</p><h2>Is 'Lovin' On You' about Luke Combs' wife, Nicole Hocking?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/the-real-meaning-behind-luke-combs-lovin-on-you/is-lovin-on-you-about-luke-combs-wife-nicole-hocking-1622739882.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Shutterstock</span><p dir=ltr>Listening to <a href=#>"Lovin' On You"</a> from Luke Combs certainly makes what the star appreciates obvious. However, even though he mentions plenty of things he likes, he only sings about one thing that he loves.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>"But I'm in love and lovin' on you / I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room / I can't get enough of you, honey / You're right on the money," Combs sings in the chorus of the song written by himself along with James McNair, Ray Fulcher, and Thomas Archer, according to <a href=#>Genius</a>. He also repeats, "I'm in love and lovin' on you."</p><p>While Combs is obviously singing about a certain someone that he seems to love (and loves "lovin' on"), he doesn't exactly name who that is. Of course, we're going to go ahead and assume that it's <a href=#>his wife, Nicole Hocking</a>. We know that he wrote his 2017 song "Beautiful Crazy" for Hocking (despite the fact that they weren't even dating yet), so it wouldn't be the first time he showed a little love for the lady in his life through his music. Telling <a href=#>The Artist and The Athlete</a> podcast that "Beautiful Crazy" was the song that was played during the first dance at the <a href=#>couple's wedding in 2020</a>, he explained, "There's no way that any other song will top that as far as sentimental value for me." Granted, we're sure that "Lovin' On You" is still pretty darn special.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWpnbX91e9OhnGaqlZa5brnEmqWippdir6a0yKebZqSloLJur86mmaxlnKTDqrqMqKVmsZ%2BqfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-challenge-season-39-melissa-reeves-said-shes-been-saving-some-truths-about-castmates-for-reunion.html><span>←</span><span>The Challenge Season 39: Melissa Reeves said shes been saving some truths about castmates f</span></a>
