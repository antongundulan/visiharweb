News</a>. By 2011, their first daughter, Jordan Kay, was born, and in 2013, Federline and Prince took a trip to Las Vegas where he surprised her with wedding plans. Two days later, they were married. The couple welcomed a second daughter, Peyton Marie, in 2014 (he also has <a href=#>two children with Shar Jackson</a>). A source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, "It's about time Kevin got over Britney and went on with life," adding, "Victoria is an awesome girl."</p><p dir=ltr>That might be true, however, it's hard for us to know that, since Prince isn't the type of person to regularly make major headline-worthy news or spend her days on social media. But that doesn't mean that we weren't able to track down some intriguing info about the woman who is step-mom to Spears' sons.</p><p dir=ltr>Born in Richland, Wash., per <a href=#>Hawaii Athletics</a>, <a href=#>People</a> notes that Prince grew up with two brothers and a sister in Kennewick. Playing "varsity volleyball in high school," she went on to Washington State University before getting a degree in speech from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. These days, E! reports that she's a special education teacher. She's apparently also a music fan. Hawaii Athletics noted that her "favorite artist is Jay-Z," although we're sure she appreciates songs from Spears as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW1ga4V6e9ahpmaho2K4psLIp2SfnZSav621zZ6qZq%2BZm7Juwsicq6iqmZZ6sb7Ip5qeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-joe-rogans-wife-jessica-ditzel.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Joe Rogans Wife, Jessica Ditzel?</span></a>
