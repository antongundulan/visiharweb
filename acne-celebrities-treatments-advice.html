Because I fly so much, hydration is important. When you have good skin, everything else kind of falls into place. Also, I use blush with shimmer in it. That way, your skin glows and people notice it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4c6a8d9385db-acne-eva-longoria-z.jpg><h2>Cameron Diaz</h2><p id=eqmD9THHi7Fg data-wc=103>For Cameron, it was all about swapping her diet. Writing about acne in her book, she explained: "I mean, I had terrible, terrible skin. It was embarrassing. I used to eat a cheeseburger and fries every day. But once I stopped, a funny thing happened…my skin began to clear up. My acne wasn't totally gone, but it was significantly better. Looking back, I realise that I hadn't needed those prescription drugs, those vials of potions and creams... I hadn't needed to be angry at my skin or feel bad about myself. I had just needed to LISTEN TO MY BODY."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/284c093c7805-acne-cameron-diaz-z.jpg><h2>Kendall Jenner</h2><p id=ekbta5_l0_HQ data-wc=98>After looking stunning on the red carpet at the Golden Globes, Kendall owned her skin blemishes, tweeting: "Never let that [expletive] stop you." Chatting about her acne on her website back in 2015, she wrote: "I had such bad acne when I was younger; I remember it SO well. I started having skin issues around the 8th or 9th grade. I think I just got acne from being a teenager and simply growing up, which happens to SO many people. But, where it really impacted me was how self-conscious I became about it. It completely ruined my self-esteem." &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/09762738a633-acne-kendall-jenner-z.jpg><h2>Lorde</h2><p id=e27kR_irbmep data-wc=59>Lorde has previously shared make-up free selfies while using spot cream, and took to Twitter to complain when photos emerged where her blemishes had been photoshopped out. Posting them next to the original snaps, she wrote: "I find this curious - two photos from today, one edited so my skin is perfect and one real. Remember flaws are OK."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7692cc61f655-acne-lorde-z.jpg><h2>Natalie Portman</h2><p id=e2pXvoUi12nK data-wc=45>For the actress, it was all about cutting out a certain type of food – dairy! Natalie, who is also a vegan, told : "I cut out dairy and eggs, and I never had a breakout after. That was definitely a discovery."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/723a2b3b935c-acne-natalie-portman-z.jpg><h2>Victoria Beckham</h2><p id=etviZ5Rdfco_ data-wc=78>The mum-of-four has one man to thank for her beautiful skin, and previously told magazine: "I swear by Dr Lancer products. He's a dermatologist that I met in Los Angeles. I started going to him for oxygen facials, and I haven't looked back. I don't really use products other than his. I keep it quite simple with a really good polish, then an exfoliating cleanse, then I use a nourish cream, which is a really beautiful moisturiser."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=ePkLgYPct3xj data-wc=57>She added to : "I've known [Doctor Lancer] for years — he sorted my skin out. I used to have really problematic skin and he said to me, 'You have to eat salmon every single day.' I said, 'Really, every day?' And he said, 'Yes; breakfast, lunch or dinner, you have to eat it every single day.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/90883f318866-acne-victoria-beckham-z.jpg><h2>Miley Cyrus</h2><p id=eJZ013w95RxA data-wc=109>Miley admitted that bad skin was a big problem for her when she was younger, and revealed that she left it up to the professionals to fix after attempting to use products made it worse. She told : "I had kind of bad skin when I was younger and that was always my insecurity, especially being on TV… You think that's the only thing people can see… You get out of control, you start reaching for whatever and you end up messing up your face. Let professionals do it and don't start getting in there and giving yourself scars. All my doctors are like, 'You try to self-diagnose.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1207658e4c9a-acne-miley-cyrus-z.jpg><h2>Chloe Moretz</h2><p id=evEbc3CQIj8F style=text-align:justify data-wc=56>Chloe struggled with cystic acne while growing up, and revealed to magazine that she went to Accutane to help clear her skin up. "I dealt with really bad cystic acne growing up," she said. "I tried changing my diet and my beauty products before going on Accutane. [Having acne] was a long, hard, emotional process."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6d4105354eb2-acne-chloe-moretz-z.jpg><h2>Rihanna</h2><p id=evsyP89ZR-10 data-wc=82>Rihanna's advice is to drink plenty of water and distract from skin problems with a great lipstick. She told : "When I feel like my skin has had it, I cut out all alcohol and overdo the water," adding the a bright lipstick "draws attention away from any flaws". She also told magazine that her skin problems come around every now and again, explaining: "I have an ugly day every month; pimples on my face… It's more like an ugly week."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d712924d0dd4-acne-rihanna-z.jpg><h2>Kerry Washington</h2><p id=eez4r-7KW8it data-wc=54>Kerry relies on help from a dermatologist for her problems with eczema. She told magazine: "I've always understood the connection between science and skin. I've been seeing a dermatologist since I was 6 years old for eczema. I really believe in exfoliating and I also use a red light for dealing with bacteria."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b6ec5142a600-acne-kerry-washington-z.jpg><p id=e-lpnF0s79CA style=text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKqkoZ6YrrOxjJqlnWWWp66ovsCnmp6rX2d9coSPamhwbGVqf3V7wJylnmWTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2LBs7HAraSepqSoeqKw1aKanmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./popular.html><span>←</span><span>song</span></a>
