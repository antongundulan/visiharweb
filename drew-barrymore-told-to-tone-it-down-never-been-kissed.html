In the 1999 film, Barrymore plays 25-year-old Josie Geller, a copy editor at The Chicago Sun-Times who heads back to high school to report on an undercover story for the paper.

(God love her, but Josie’s nickname was “Josie Grossie,” after all.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/my34CRKTRyLDNXn28LBTZf-1920-80.jpg><p>Never Been Kissed was the first effort from Barrymore’s production company, Flower Films, and Barrymore said “At that time, people were very weary of actors being producers,” she said. “A lot of it wasn’t necessarily working, and it didn’t mean because you were an actor you knew how to produce the film. And it was about the economics. So if you didn’t make the film work, and you produced it as an actor, you are likely to not be able to do it again.”</p><p>Barrymore said the pressure of both starring in and producing the movie made her “very stressed,” adding “I was so scared during the whole film because I knew if it didn’t work, we weren’t going to get another chance.” She said that, although she had “so much fun” making the film, she had to “clench her stomach the whole time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pMR7m85LdwSoxREveQSCdX-1920-80.jpg><p>Meanwhile, Barrymore said that as filming was underway, “I would get these calls from the studio and they were like, ‘I’m sorry, but you’re just looking too unattractive. Stop it,’” she said. “And I was like, ‘Good.’ And they were like, ‘No, no, no, no, no. It’s too far.' So I was forced to even tone it down a little bit because I had gone even farther than that.”</p><p>Barrymore came around when “they said something that appealed to my sensibilities rather than my ego,” she said. “They were like, ‘We don’t want you to lose the heart because you’re going so far for the comedy.’ And I was like, ‘Great argument. Let me dial it back a little bit.’ And so Josie what you see there is me dialed back, and it came out, and it worked. And we got really lucky and I’m very, very grateful and I would walk around just going ‘I can’t believe this worked. We’re gonna get a second shot.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9mtjK5ejCyF2jVbYbvGoS4-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vWAEe2W2fMB5SRWVZL5b3A-1920-80.jpg><p>In addition to Barrymore, Never Been Kissed stars Michael Vartan, David Arquette, Leelee Sobieski, Molly Shannon, and John C.
