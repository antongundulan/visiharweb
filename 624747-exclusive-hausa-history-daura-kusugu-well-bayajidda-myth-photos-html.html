However, the people could only fetch the water on Fridays because of a strange snake that lived inside the well.</p><p>The people continued to live with days of thirst due to lack of water, until one day a man who was believed to be a Baghdad Prince, Abu Yazid&nbsp;came to Daura because he could not become King after the death of his father.</p><p>The brave Prince after lodging in the house of an old woman called Ayyana, requested for&nbsp;water. He was not given enough water. He later requested&nbsp;to be shown the well to fetch water. He was warned about the strange snake that frightened the people from fetching water daily. He went to the well and eventually killed the snake after a fierce fight.</p><p>The Queen of the town married him for his bravery. He later became the King. Because be could not speak&nbsp;Hausa, people started calling him Bayajidda, meaning, <i>"Someone who does not understand before.''</i></p><p>The Queen bore Bayajjida seven children that ruled over the seven Hausa states called <i>''Hausa Bakwai.''</i></p><p>The current president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari is from Daura. He has a house inside the town. He is currently the second in line to Bayajidda of the Daura Emirate.</p><p>Legit.ng reporter brings exclusive pictures from the president's resident in Daura, Kusugu well and Emir's Palace shown below:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5d96stqakf7.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4upaaodpjv6.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt559647t4klg.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytb1g8o1jlbro.jpg><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3OAlm1uZp2omLm2v8ivnGagkarAonnHoqqtp6KueqWt1KuYZqOlqMKowYywnKWkXZeuuq3JopudmV2ixrW0jKmfqKyfqHupwMyl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hailee-steinfield-actor-film-script.html><span>←</span><span>Hailee Steinfield interview: The first movie to inspire me was Paper Moon | Film</span></a>
