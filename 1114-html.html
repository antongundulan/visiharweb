From the recording, the last words the pilot told the radar control unit was, “1181, good day,” in response to some information he had received from the ATC on duty.</p><p>The ATC had told him to contact the Control Tower on frequency 1181. The pilot, who had declared emergency to the ATCs in the radar control room, replied, “1181 good day,” meaning he had got the information.</p><p>According to ATCs, “good day” is the usual parlance they and pilots use in signing off from a conversation.</p><p>From his accent, it was obvious he was the Indian co-pilot, Mr. Mahendra Roathore, who spoke with the ATCs during the last minutes of the tragic flight.</p><p>The pilot, an American, Captain Peter Waxtan, was said to have been busy, struggling to keep the aircraft in flight, while the co-pilot spoke with the ATCs.</p><p>Below is the word-for-word account of the conversation between the crew of the ill-fated plane and the ATC on duty.</p><p>Co-pilot: “Lagos Tower, Dana code 0992!”</p><p>ATC: “Dana Code 0992, this is Lagos radar, go ahead!”</p><p>Co-pilot: “May Day! May Day! May Day! Dana code 0992 Five November Romeo Alpha Mike! (5N-RAM) dual engine failure!”</p><p>ATC: “Dana Code 0992, read me?”</p><p>Co-pilot: “I read you five by five! Dual engine failure! Negative response from throttle! Requesting for direct straight approach!”</p><p>ATC: “Alright, position it one mile to touch down, Runway 18R! Contact tower now on 1181!”</p><p>Co-pilot: “1181 Good day!”</p><p>Unfortunately, the crew never spoke with the control tower. The aircraft crashed into the residential building a few seconds after this discussion.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnJ9k2efraWc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dakota-johnson-black-velvet-strapless-minidress.html><span>←</span><span>Dakota Johnson Makes Black the Happiest Color in a Velvet Minidress</span></a>
