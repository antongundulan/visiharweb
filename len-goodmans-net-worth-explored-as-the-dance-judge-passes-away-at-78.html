He made most of this money from his long and illustrious television career. He was paid $125K for his stint on the first season of Dancing with the Stars in 2005. The salary later went up to $1.2 million per season.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Goodman also made around £250K every season of Strictly Come Dancing. However, the dance coach had an extremely humble beginning. His grandfather used to sell fruit and vegetables in the streets. Goodman, himself, started his career as an apprentice welder for Harland and Wolff.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He started dancing at the age of 19 as a therapy suggested by his doctor for a foot injury. He then took up the art professionally and took part in several competitions. He also won the British Championships in his late twenties.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.llanelliherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/129469037_lenindex_bbc.jpg alt width=976 height=549 sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><span style=font-weight:400>Television Career</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 2004, Goodman appeared as the judge of the British dance reality series Strictly Come Dancing. The following year, he was made the judge of the American adaptation of the competition, Dancing with the Stars, along with Carrie Ann Inaba and Bruno Tonioli. Goodman left Strictly Come Dancing in 2016 but continued with DWTS till 2022, and appeared in 29 seasons of the show.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He also hosted his own shows and appeared in several docu-films, including Len Goodman’s Dance Band Days, Len Goodman’s Perfect Christmas, Len and Ainsley’s Big Food Adventure, Strictly Len Goodman, and Len Goodman’s Partners in Rhyme. Apart from his TV career, Goodman also authored a book named Better Late Than Never: from Barrowboy to Ballroom in 2008.</span></p><h2><span style=font-weight:400>Retirement and Death</span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.llanelliherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/b8de7c8c-fee8-4d81-a183-3a1a940ee529.jpg alt width=960 height=640 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Goodman announced his retirement from DWTS during the season 31 semifinals in November 2022, stating that he wanted to spend more time with his family. “Doing a live show you have to be at the top of your game and quick to react. And as one gets older, then things start to get more challenging. I haven’t fallen asleep or started dribbling yet on the show, so I thought it’s best to go before I start to do so!” he said at the time.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Goodman also faced a number of health problems in his life. He underwent surgery for </span><span style=font-weight:400>prostate cancer</span><span style=font-weight:400> in 2009 and for </span><span style=font-weight:400>facial melanoma</span><span style=font-weight:400> in 2020. He later battled bone cancer and passed away from the illness in April 2023 after spending a few days in hospice care in England. “A much-loved husband, father and grandfather who will be sorely missed by family, friends and all who knew him,” Goodman’s manager announced on April 24, 2023.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For more news and updates, keep watching this space.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbjAp5ylpJmdsrOty51lnKedZH5yg5doo56mXZy8sLDMmqWsZZ6awW7DzquroWWVrb2tu9Gem2aZo2LBqbGMnZinm5Vit7awxp5kqZmjqLK0ecCwmLJlkal6eISO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./414381-legendary-dancer-bruno-pop-n-taco-falcon-dead-at-58-news.html><span>←</span><span>Legendary Dancer Bruno &amp;quot;Pop N Taco&amp;quot; Falcon Dead At 58</span></a>
