"We have seen that when you went out into the world, you gave it your very best. You should be proud of the friend that you were, the teammate that you were, and what you left behind and the people that knew you that we trust will go forward and continue to make the world a better place."</p><p>His voice cracked as he continued speaking.</p><p>"With respect to what you mean to our family, it's in our hearts. There are no words. We love you. We will continue to hold you in our hearts and we will always be the Bailey Seven."</p><p>He thanked the judge for the sentence he handed down.</p><p>"We are very appreciative of this outcome and felt that it is the right verdict, considering how heinous the crime is and Aiden's behavior around it."</p><p>He added Fucci's family should not be mistreated because they're in pain, too.</p><p>"Please extend them kindness. They should be given grace for the pain they're going through. They should not be given additional hardship."</p><p>Tristyn was found dead in woods outside Jacksonville.

Russell was on her honeymoon when she learned that her sister was missing.</p><p class=endmark>“Agony isn’t painful enough. Shattered to the core doesn’t crumble like how I feel. Infuriated doesn’t even come close to touching the amount of rage I find myself trapped in,” she said. “And let me tell you, justice is just a word for comfort. It doesn’t bring her back,” she said.</p><span class="byline-thumbnail byline-thumbnail--no-image expanded-byline__thumbnail" data-testid=byline-thumbnail></span><span class="byline-name expanded-byline__name" data-testid=byline-name>Antonio Planas</span><span class="byline-social expanded-byline__social"></span><p class="byline-bio expanded-byline__bio">Antonio Planas is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.&nbsp;</p><p>Minyvonne Burke and Tim Stelloh contributed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r67Cp5ywq16YvK57zZ6urGelqHqvsdasZq2dlaN6tLHNrZynm5WZeq21xZ5kqaqZqLyvecWaq5qknK56tMDAm5mippdis6270aKbmmWTnbKmvsuemJ2domJ%2BcoCMq5qnmWdrgnZ8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adrienne-bailon-net-worth-2024-2.html><span>←</span><span>Adrienne Bailon Net Worth 2024</span></a>
