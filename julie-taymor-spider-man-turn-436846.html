The ousted director first pursued arbitration over $500,000 in claimed royalties. Then, in November of 2011, she alleged that as a co-owner of the book of the musical, she had a copyright claim to the show’s underlying material, which she said still reflected her significant contributions to the story.</p><p>In August, it seemed that the two sides had <a href=# rel=noopener>reached a deal</a>, but they were unable to complete it, and the <a href=# rel=noopener>case was reopened</a>&nbsp;this past December. They faced a trial in May, and so a deal this month helps them to narrowly avoid an open court battle. Believed to be at issue in settlement talks were the rights to reproduce the show in international territories. That aspect is reflected in comments from both parties on the settlement.</p><p>“We’re happy to put all this behind us,” said producers <strong>Michael Cohl </strong>and <strong>Jeremiah Harris</strong> of 8 Legged Productions. “We are now looking forward to spreading Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark in new and exciting ways around the world”</p><p>“I’m pleased to have reached an agreement and hope for the continued success of Spider-Man, both on Broadway and beyond,” added Taymor.</p><p class=Default><span class=Apple-style-span>The show, at $75 million the most expensive in Broadway history, has received poor reviews; it began with record-breaking business, but <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">according to the New York Times</a>, sales have flattened to just over $1 million a week, which, given its very costly technical arrangements, is barely enough to cover expenses.</span></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKvBy6KcZqyRrrqwvoysp6Kclad6rq3NZquuqp5igXSCl21taA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./toryburch-com.html><span>←</span><span>Tory Burch promo codes - 15% off in July 2024</span></a>
