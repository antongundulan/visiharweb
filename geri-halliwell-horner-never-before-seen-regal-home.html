In the snap, Geri was poised at a chic garden table with her laptop in her sage green "writing shed" which was adorned with floral portraits. The image prior to the at-home snap, showed Geri standing on a ladder in front of a number of copies of her new book.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/804b3ac95664-img9485.jpg><p id=eGjgnqiHUk0 data-wc=56>Captioning the post she penned: "Now and then - <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>@rosiefrostfalconqueen</a> edition. A dream becomes a reality! So grateful that all those days in the writing shed led me here." The verdant-hued section of her home show in the candid writing snap could be mistaken for one of King Charles and Queen Camilla's rooms at Clarence House.&nbsp;</p><p id=efpsdpyEn_7 data-wc=37>Camilla was previously captured posing in her own sage green room when she joined Princess Kate for a conference call back in 2020. Like Geri's floral portraits, the Queen also had dark mahogany frames covering the wall.&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eZ5PnXYdqBB data-wc=54>Friends and fans of the flame-haired pop star were quick to rush in with comments. "Ahh a writing shed. Mine was a shepherd's hut," one fan penned. A second replied: "Love this [red love heart emoji] &nbsp;always dream big and believe xxx." Meanwhile, a third penned: "So proud of u! You are my inspiration!"</p><p id=eK_Foslx24f data-wc=53>Geri and her husband, F1 president Christian Horner, have an impressive net worth of around £440 million, allowing them to have quite the property portfolio.
