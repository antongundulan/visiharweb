Under the name Jeff Gamble, he made his WCW debut on the November 17, 1990 edition of WCW Saturday Night, facing off against The Big Cat (also known as Mr. Hughes) in a losing effort. Gann later adopted the Gambler persona while working in the USWA in 1992 before returning to WCW in 1993 with the same gimmick.</p><p>During his time in WCW, Gann primarily served as a “jobber to the stars,” putting over numerous top talents in the promotion. Although he had occasional wins on WCW Pro and WCW Saturday Night, they were mostly against other enhancement talents. One of his notable achievements came in USWA when he held the USWA Tag Team Titles alongside Brickhouse Brown for 16 days in April 1995.</p><p>While Gann remained on the WCW roster until 1999, his in-ring appearances dwindled significantly during his later years with the company. He wrestled only a few matches in 1997 and 1998, and six matches in 1999, with his final match taking place on the August 21, 1999 edition of WCW Saturday Night, where he was defeated by Johnny Attitude.</p><p>After his release from WCW on August 31, 1999, Gann did not continue his career in professional wrestling. In recent years, he declined at least one indie booking opportunity.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>We extend our condolences to the family, friends, and fans of Jeff Gann during this difficult time.
