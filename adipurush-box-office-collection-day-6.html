The film, which was released on June 16, 2023, with a massive budget of Rs 500 crore, has failed to impress both critics and audiences with its lackluster script, poor visual effects and controversial portrayal of Hindu deities.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Adipurush_Day_6_Collection_A_Steep_Fall></span>Adipurush Day 6 Collection: A Steep Fall<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to trade portal Sacnilk, early estimates suggest that the Prabhas-starrer earned only about Rs 10.80 crore in India on the sixth day since its release on Tuesday. This is a steep fall from its opening day collection of Rs 80 crore, which was boosted by the hype and curiosity around the film. The film’s total domestic collection now stands at Rs 215.80 crore, which is far below the expectations of the makers and distributors.</p><p>The film’s performance in overseas markets is also dismal, as it has collected only Rs 75 crore in four days. The film’s worldwide collection now stands at Rs 290.80 crore, which is barely enough to recover its production and marketing costs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Adipurush_Review_A_Missed_Opportunity></span>Adipurush Review: A Missed Opportunity<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adipurush, directed by Om Raut, was touted as a magnum opus that would showcase the glory and valor of Lord Rama and his army of monkeys in their battle against the demon king Ravana, played by Saif Ali Khan. However, the film turned out to be a missed opportunity, as it failed to capture the essence and spirit of the original epic.</p><p>The film received mostly negative reviews from critics, who slammed it for its weak screenplay, poor direction, shoddy editing and mediocre acting. The film also faced backlash from some Hindu groups, who accused it of hurting their religious sentiments by showing Lord Rama and Hanuman in a negative light. The film was also criticized for its poor visual effects, which looked outdated and unrealistic.</p><p>The film’s only saving grace was Prabhas’ star power, which drew his fans to the theatres. However, even his loyal fan base could not save the film from becoming a flop.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Adipurush_Verdict_A_Disaster></span>Adipurush Verdict: A Disaster<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adipurush is one of the biggest disasters of 2023, as it has failed to live up to its hype and potential. The film has not only disappointed the fans of Prabhas and Ramayana, but also tarnished the reputation of Om Raut, who had earlier delivered a blockbuster with Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:- <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adipurush Box Office Collection Day 3 Worldwide</a></strong></p><p>The film’s poor collections have sealed its fate, as it might now struggle to cross the lifetime Hindi total of even Ranbir Kapoor’s Tu Jhooti Main Makkaar. The film’s failure is also a setback for T-Series, which had invested heavily in the project.</p><p>Adipurush is a lesson for filmmakers who try to cash in on the popularity of mythological stories without doing justice to them. The film is a reminder that content is king, and no amount of star power or budget can save a bad film.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Adipurush_Box_Office_Collection_Day_6_Summary></span>Adipurush Box Office Collection Day 6: Summary<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tr><th>Day</th><th>India</th><th>Overseas</th><th>Worldwide</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>80 cr</td><td>25 cr</td><td>105 cr</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>40 cr</td><td>15 cr</td><td>55 cr</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>30 cr</td><td>10 cr</td><td>40 cr</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>25 cr</td><td>10 cr</td><td>35 cr</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>20 cr</td><td>10 cr</td><td>30 cr</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>10.8 cr</td><td>5 cr</td><td>15.8 cr</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>215.8 cr</strong></td><td><strong>75 cr</strong></td><td><strong>290.8 cr</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGikqK6ZmsBwrcOip66qpai1bq7OsWSonpaesKZ5wqijpZ2TqbawuoydmLJlZmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mitch-narito-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mitch Narito Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
