data-sourcepos=7:1-7:137><span>Yep,</span><span> you read that right.</span><span> </span><strong>Celine Dion</strong><span>,</span><span> the queen of belting power ballads,</span><span> once resided in the luxurious Lake Las Vegas community.</span><span> Imagine strolling down the sidewalk and bumping into her belting out "My Heart Will Go On" while walking her poodle.</span><span> (Though,</span><span> with a voice like that,</span><span> maybe it wouldn't be a bump,</span><span> more like a gentle serenade?</span><span>)</span></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:244><span>Speaking of living large,</span><span> boxing champ </span><strong>Floyd Mayweather Jr.</strong><span> is another Vegas resident.</span><span> Just picture him rolling up to the grocery store in his customized Rolls Royce to pick up a gallon of milk (because even champions need calcium,</span><span> folks).</span></p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:9><span>Las Vegas isn't just for singers and boxers,</span><span> though.</span><span> We've also got legendary magician </span><strong>David Copperfield</strong><span> making suburbs of Summerlin his disappearing act headquarters.</span><span> Maybe he can teach us how to make our ever-growing pile of laundry vanish?</span></p><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:233><span>But wait,</span><span> there's more!</span><span> </span><strong>Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf</strong><span>,</span><span> the tennis power couple who could backhand a compliment like nobody's business,</span><span> call Vegas home.</span><span> Imagine the epic tennis matches they must have going on in their backyard!</span></p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:230><span>This is just a taste of the star-studded soiree that is Las Vegas.</span><span> You never know who you might run into at a blackjack table,</span><span> or catching a Cirque du Soleil show (which,</span><span> come to think of it,</span><span> might be the same thing these days).</span></p><h3

you know,</span><span> wear a giant feathered boa as headwear – Vegas doesn't judge.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=22:1-22:201><strong>Taxes, taxes, and more taxes (but way less):</strong><span> Nevada boasts some of the lowest taxes in the country.</span><span> That means celebrities can keep more of their hard-earned (or should we say,</span><span> gambled?</span><span>) cash.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=23:1-24:0><strong>Entertainment capital of the world (right in your backyard):</strong><span> Who needs to fly out to see a fancy show when you have world-class
