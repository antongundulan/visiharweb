All other details remain under wraps.</p><p>However, as 2023 comes to an end, Chelsea took to Instagram to share a photo of herself with an out of focus with a ‚Äúmama‚Äù necklace and her baby‚Äôs hand reaching up for her.</p><p>She captioned the share, ‚Äú2023..

While she and Austen dated for a little while, things didn‚Äôt work out.</p><p>Ahead of Season 7, Chelsea wasn‚Äôt the only cast member to exit. Her good friends Cameran Eubanks and Naomie Olindo joined her. The women exited the show together, leaving Season 7 to look vastly different than what viewers had come to know.</p><p>Despite viewers missing Chelsea on the show, don‚Äôt expect her to return anytime soon. She reportedly left because she wanted a more private life, and with a new baby, that is even more important to the former reality TV star.</p><p>Chelsea Meissner is at a new point in her life, and Southern Charm is a chapter likely closed for good. However, being a mama seems to be her most exciting chapter yet.</p><p>Southern Charm airs Thursdays at 8/7c on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6OkwrW0xKulZpuYlr%2Buv4ycn56ko5qubrnEoqqsppWnerS0wKucrGWWnr%2B0wIygo6KloKiybrvFZp2iqqOpeqOtwbJm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sofia-vergara-heidi-klum-figure-hugging-glam-outfits-girls-night-out.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Sofia Vergara and Heidi Klum rock figure-hugging glam outfits in photos from girls night out</span></a>
