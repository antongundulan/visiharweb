The Mirror points out that William was not alone in this, and that the majority of the royal family bowed or curtseyed to the King only. Royal protocol states that royals of a lower rank must bow or curtsy to those in a higher rank—so William and basically all of the other members of the royal family should have bowed or curtseyed to the new Queen.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eb9gkAiXkLGz3uofKbxdXD-1920-80.jpg><p>While the possibility does exist that he had already bowed earlier in the day off camera and didn’t feel the need to do so again, James says “Would William have felt comfortable bowing to the woman who took the place of his mother on the throne of the U.K.? He turns to look at his father but avoids looking at his stepmother.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8BenwCnSNprYyx42yerCwD-1920-80.jpg><p>James calls this “a unique example of selective bowing,” noting that William and his two eldest children <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-george/>Prince George</a> and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/princess-charlotte/>Princess Charlotte</a> also opted not to bow or curtsy to Camilla.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
