 Instructions for Caring for a European Cypress Tree
POSITIONING: In close proximity to a sunny window, away from direct heat sources. (Some ornaments may come in a bag, depending on the manufacturer.)
WATERING: Always keep the soil wet, but not waterlogged, to prevent weed growth.
 TRANSPLANTING: Trees may be transplanted outside in Zones 5-9 if they are not frozen. Transplanting iced trees is not something we encourage."><meta name=author content="Kelle Repass"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
