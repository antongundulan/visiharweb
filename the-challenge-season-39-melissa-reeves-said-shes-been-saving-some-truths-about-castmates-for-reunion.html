Lucky for his relationship,” Melissa said.</p><p>That prompted a response from Ed, who claimed Melissa shouldn’t be upset with him so much.</p><p>“your whole team was working against you on that one. I was just reinforcing the plan that the other 20 of us came up with,” he wrote.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-did-ed-say-about-melissa-in-episode-6>What did Ed say about Melissa in Episode 6?</h2><p>For Season 39, Episode 6, the competitors were split into three teams for a daily challenge called Bingo Bango. It was a physical event with three individuals, one from each team, battling over a numbered ball in a mud pit during each round.</p><p>The goal was to grab numbers to complete a BINGO on the giant board. The winning team got to choose one woman who would be up for possible elimination.</p><p>During the event, a plan was hatched by multiple players to make sure Melissa’s team didn’t win the event. That included keeping Melissa down so she couldn’t retrieve a numbered ball from the pit for her team.</p><p>At one point in the footage, Ed instructed Nurys, “Go hold her down. Go hold her down,” and told his other teammates that was their plan as they continued playing.</p><p>“If we haven’t sent someone in, just hold them down,” Ed said regarding the strategy.</p><p>With two teams working against one, the Red Team ultimately won. After some disputes from Kyland Young to not say Melissa’s name, the majority of the team voted on the spot for Melissa to face possible elimination at The Arena.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>While Melissa was the Red Team’s choice, the rest of the cast later voted for her friend Tula “Big T” Fazakerley as the other individual up for elimination.</p><p>However, the two friends didn’t battle each other at The Arena. Instead, Big T went against two-time Challenge winner <a href=#>Kaz Crossley</a>. Big T defeated The Challenge: UK and World Championship winner to keep the cast’s money intact and remain in the competition.</p><p>Based on Melissa’s remarks about Ed, she’s got some serious information that could potentially ruin his relationship. However, she indicated he didn’t receive an invite for a Season 39 reunion, so he got “lucky” she won’t expose him on TV.</p><p>The Challenge: Battle For a New Champion airs Wednesdays at 8/7c on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6Sdsm6vx5qjpZ2enLJuv8SaqqimXWiGbrnEpaCsq5Fiv6ax1Z6qZquRnrFuv8eeqmaalZq7br%2FAr6Cnn12ovK6xjK2prqyYqHqirs6uq2abkajBrq3Tnqpmnp%2BnerOx1KegqKZf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patrick-j-adams-meghan-markle-throwback-suits-photos-deleted-sag-strike-7975391.html><span>←</span><span>Suits Star Patrick J.
