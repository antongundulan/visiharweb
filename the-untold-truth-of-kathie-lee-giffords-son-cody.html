Aside from popping up on his mom's shows when <a href=#>he and his sister, Cassidy, were young</a>, Cody also worked with Kathie Lee on Today as an intern when she hosted the fourth hour with <a href=#>Hoda Kotb</a>.</p><p>Not only was Cody an all-around helper (as interns are!), but he also co-hosted a segment called "<a href=#>Weekend Movie Preview</a>," where he gave his own recommendations and film critiques. However, Kathie Lee didn't always make the job easy for her son. "She keeps telling Jill [one of the other employees] that I have a crush on her," he joked during an <a href=#>interview</a> with Today about how his mom embarrasses him at work. " ... Just little stuff like that, it's never been detrimental to me." Gushing about Kathie Lee's influence, Cody added, "She's been very, very supportive of everything I do, whether it's sports, whether it's this, whether it's pursuing a career in film studies and ultimately hopefully directing one day, she's been great."</p><p>Today show executive producer Jim Bell defended the decision to hire Cody amid cries of nepotism, telling the <a href=#>New York Post</a>, "Is he getting an opportunity here? Yeah, but so be it. We like him and he's a smart kid and a good kid."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2ppaIFze9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5ypqroaGVYrmmsYygoJ%2Ben6extHnSqKVmm5%2BZxnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./berlin-q-a-garmin-heir-767452.html><span>←</span><span>The Garmin Heir Behind Terrence Malicks New Movie</span></a>
