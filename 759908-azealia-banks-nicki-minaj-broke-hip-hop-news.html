"You can tell just by whatever keeps happening with Nicki's butt that she's f*cked up right now. Because there's something very f*cking wrong with the butt, and I don't know what it is. But, I do know that the surgery to get that sh*t out of there is a pretty penny," Banks says. She continues, claiming that Nicki's procedure would be especially tough. "That's a very tedious thing, and it's also a very risky procedure that she can't afford to have right now," she claims.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Unfortunately, Banks was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">far from finished</a> with Nicki. She went on to call her out for defending her brother, dub her husband Kenneth Petty a "rapist," and state that she'd feel "st*pid" if she were her right now.
