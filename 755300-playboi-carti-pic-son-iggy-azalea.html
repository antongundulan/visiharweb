Azalea confirmed that she welcomed their child back in 2020, after already breaking up with Carti.</p><p>A few months later, she explained that the rapper missed the birth of their son. Taking to Twitter, she wrote: "This man was in philly playing PS5 mid pandemic the day my son was born even tho it was a scheduled c section. I had onyx alone completely cause he was my only visitor approved with Covid. We lived together at that time." She also claimed that Carti was refusing to take responsibility for child. “And even tho onyx was a PLANNED baby, that we both wanted," she added. "On some weirdo sh*t he has still refused to sign his birth certificate. He’s 9 months old. Won’t even give his son he claims to care so much about his own last name.”</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Iggy Azalea Opens Up About "Volatile Relationship" With Playboi Carti</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-playboi-carti-performs-at-wireless-festival>Playboi Carti Performs At Wireless Festival</h2></span><p>LONDON, ENGLAND - JULY 07: Playboi Carti performs during day one of Wireless Festival 2023 at Finsbury Park on July 07, 2023 in London, England.

She confirmed that she was halting work on her upcoming album and will focus on other creative outputs. "In truth what I’ve known for a long time is that I feel more passionately about design and creative direction than I do about song writing. To many of you that’s no shock to read. It shows in my work. Haha! Jokes aside, I do spend a lot more time on that part of things… because I'm most confident at that. That’s why I want to let you know that I’m not going to finish my album. It’s been paused for a few months while I was giving direction for a different project & in truth I just haven’t felt the urge to go back to it.” Be on the lookout for further updates on Playboi Carti on HotNewHipHop.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Iggy Azalea & Playboi Carti: A Complete Timeline</a></strong></p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnaoJ0fI9mp6WZqZe8qnnCmqmtoV2ltqR50qilZqGXnMZurdmao56Z</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rachel-riley-pasha-kovalev-break-silence-second-baby-exclusive.html><span>←</span><span>Pasha Kovalev expresses his joy over becoming a dad again with wife Rachel Riley</span></a>
