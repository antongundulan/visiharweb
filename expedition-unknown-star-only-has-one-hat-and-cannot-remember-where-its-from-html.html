These distinctive accessories have not only become his trademarks but have also sparked curiosity among fans.

This brown hat, adorned with jagged edges, is a constant companion on Josh’s adventures across the globe. However, what adds to the intrigue is that Josh himself revealed during a Josh Gates Live show that he only possesses one hat and cannot recall where he acquired it.</p><p>Despite speculations that it resembles Indiana Jones’ iconic headgear, Josh once purchased a Panama hat from Ecuador in a 2018 episode. He even confessed to splurging $700 on a hat in the past. The ‘Josh Gates hat’ has sported various colors, including pink and brown, but his primary hat features a brown hue with a matching band around the middle head section.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Josh’s Unique Necklace:</strong></h3><p>Josh Gates’ necklace is as renowned as his hat. He shared on DT Fan Radio that he has owned this necklace since childhood but didn’t wear it extensively after purchasing it. However, when he began his travels as an adult, he transitioned the pendant onto a new chain. Interestingly, Josh reserves the necklace exclusively for his travels, dubbing it “magical” in a playful manner.</p><p>Although he doesn’t recall the exact origins of the necklace, Josh mentioned that it might have been acquired during one of their annual trips to England, where his mother is from. He spotted it in a store, bought it, and retained it, often storing it in a drawer until he had the chain replaced and started wearing it again.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Josh Gates’ Expedition Unknown Ventures:</strong></h3><p>In Expedition Unknown, Josh Gates embarks on journeys to uncover lost artifacts and investigate unsolved mysteries worldwide. While his quests often yield no major discoveries, they occasionally offer vital clues or intriguing insights. With a degree in Archaeology from Tufts University and membership in The Explorers Club, Josh is a trusted figure in the field. He also serves as a trustee on the governing board of the Archaeological Institute of America.</p><p>Josh’s adventures have taken him to diverse locations, from exploring a 2,500-year-old mummy of a high priest to searching for creatures that inspired the sea creature known as Lusca. He’s even had the opportunity to dive with man-eating Tiger Sharks in the Bahamas, an adventure he undertook with the legendary William Shatner, venturing where no host has gone before.</p><p>As Josh Gates continues his captivating journeys on Expedition Unknown, fans eagerly anticipate each new episode, not just for the adventures but also to catch glimpses of his iconic hat and mysterious necklace.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiaHxyfI6er6mdlJ7BqrvNZqyno56kxK950q2Yq2Wfo7m6eceaqmannpp6qa3TZpinnF2Yrq%2B6zq1kq52dmrqjsdFmrqGdopp6qsDSZp2rp51jtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heidi-range-announces-pregnancy-hello-exclusive.html><span>←</span><span>Exclusive: Sugababes star Heidi Range and husband Alex Partakis are expecting their second child</span></a>
