Henry&nbsp;</span><span>, the co-founder of the infamous sports management company, Fenway Sports Group.&nbsp;Fenway owns the MLB franchise with multiple World Series victories, the Boston Red Sox, and historic Premier League football club Liverpool.&nbsp;Pizzuti is also a shareholder of Fenway as well as a film producer, managing director of&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Boston Globe</span></i><span>&nbsp;and many more.</span></p><h2><b><span>The biography of Linda Pizzuti</span></b></h2><p><span>The American businesswoman was born on September 20, 1978, in Lynnfield, Massachusetts.&nbsp;Her father, Don Pizzuti, is an Italian immigrant who made his living as a real estate developer and engineer.&nbsp;His mother, Maria Pizzuti, was a housewife.</span></p><p><span>For her education, Pizzuti attended Babson College where she graduated with a bachelor’s degree.&nbsp;She then took a master’s degree in real estate development at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was 26 when she graduated.</span></p><p><span>Linda has three older sisters and growing up, their father taught them the ropes of the real estate business.&nbsp;During this period, they worked in their father’s agency.&nbsp;After college, Linda helped grow her father’s agency until her personal endeavors and marriage won out.</span></p><p><span>Linda Pizzuti met John Henry on the night of June 6, 2008.
