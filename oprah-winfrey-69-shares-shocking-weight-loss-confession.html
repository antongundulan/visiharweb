At its core, the drug impacts feelings of fullness or satiety in the brain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/50faa62d21af-oprah-winfrey-cake.jpg><p id=eAi5Ihn5ONa data-wc=42>But Oprah's admission transcended beyond the medication itself, offering a reflection on societal perspectives about body image and weight loss. She pondered: "Shouldn't we all just be more accepting of whatever body you choose to be in? That should be your choice.”&nbsp;</p><p id=eoekhSRQvml data-wc=18>The media mogul juxtaposed her discovery of weight loss medications with her recovery journey from a knee surgery.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/160eb0530622-oprah-winfrey-home-pool.jpg><p id=eLbhd9yLmqZ data-wc=44>The thought of opting for a 'shortcut', in her view, seemed contrary to her path of self-reliance and determination. In a poignant moment, Oprah shared the scrutiny and shaming she endured, with tabloids criticizing her for allegedly lacking "willpower" in her weight loss quest.</p><p id=eVwsqvf38IU data-wc=47>Offering a medical perspective, Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford emphasized that obesity isn't about willpower. She pointed out: &nbsp;“It's how our bodies regulate weight, and each of us is different. We're just different, and addressing these differences in our diverse population is pivotal to truly tackling this disease.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ad9ebd14ee7b-oprah-winfrey-white-dress.jpg><p id=euJ3KFK2RjE data-wc=25>Oprah has consistently been open about her health challenges and milestones. She recounted her arduous recovery from back-to-back knee surgeries, which became a transformative experience.&nbsp;</p><p id=eACDHiKY_AT data-wc=31>During a prior session of her "The Life You Want" class focusing on gratitude, Oprah resonated deeply with a guest's sentiment about cherishing every limb and organ. Reflecting on her recovery,&nbsp;</p><p id=ep-X6pd4s_n data-wc=33>Oprah shared: &nbsp;"When I came home the first time, I couldn't lift my heel off the bed. I committed then that if I could move again, I'd truly appreciate the gift of mobility."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/472812710e75-oprah-winfrey-green-dress.jpg><p id=eZa3vWPOlS0 data-wc=40>True to her word, Oprah embraced an active lifestyle post-recovery, with hiking becoming a therapeutic exercise. "As I was rehabilitating, I started hiking. Everyday, I tried to hike more," she elaborated, emphasizing the deepened appreciation she developed for her body.</p><p id=em0MkTOVOAQ data-wc=31>Oprah – who at her heaviest weighed 237lbs – is an ambassador for WW and once again turned to the points-based weight loss program that previously helped her lose over 40lbs.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezKmLl4mAEHP data-wc=36>"Time for a reset. I'm clearing out my fridge," she said on Instagram early last year before promoting the benefits of WW. "It brings you back to center.
