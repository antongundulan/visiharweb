Below, our rundown of the many places where Season 4 was filmed.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Lithuania provided a snowy Russian landscape.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As most fans know by now, Hopper actually survived the explosion in the underground lab in the Season 3 finale. The Season 4 trailer (seen above) sees him trapped in a snowy Russian prison. For the wintry landscape, the show filmed in Vilnius, Lithuania, at the recently vacated <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lukiskes-prison data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lukiškes Prison" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Lukiškes Prison</a> during winter 2020.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Built in 1902 under Czar Nicholas II of Russia, the prison held its last inmates in 2019 and has been remade into a cultural site featuring daily tours and a dance club inside its former Catholic Church.</p><img alt="lithuania construction history prison" title=LITHUANIA-CONSTRUCTION-HISTORY-PRISON width=1024 height=681 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/picture-taken-on-april-21-2021-shows-the-former-lukiskes-news-photo-1653494062.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">PETRAS MALUKAS</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">New Mexico stood in for the Byers' new California town.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After wrapping in Lithuania, the production moved to the Atlanta metro area, where most of Seasons 1 to 3 were filmed. Unfortunately, they were able to film for only two weeks before all Netflix shows shut down in the beginning of the pandemic. Once filming restarted, it partly took place at the streaming giant's facilities in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Several of the settings in the fictional town of Lenora Hills, California, where Eleven and the Byers family have relocated, are actually landmarks in Albuquerque. Scenes at their new high school were filmed at Eldorado High School, and roller skating scenes were captured at the rink Roller King. Filming also took place in the nearby town of Los Lunas and other surrounding areas.</p><img alt="stranger things l to r finn wolfhard as mike wheeler, noah schnapp as will byers and millie bobby brown as eleven in stranger things cr courtesy of netflix © 2022" title="stranger things season 4 filming locations" width=3000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/strangerthings-strangerthings4-2-00-24-22-13-rc-1653496147.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">The Hawkins scenes were still filmed in Atlanta.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The show has used the city of Atlanta and surrounding towns as stand-ins for Hawkins since Season 1, which were mostly filmed at EUE/Screen Gems Studios. Though Hawkins is a fictional town, many of its street and neighborhood names are based on real places. The Duffer brothers based the names on their memories from growing up in Durham, North Carolina.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/81e105b4-86bd-4dab-a1f8-e00063b9e433_1609381211.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" title="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Quinci LeGardye is an LA-based freelance writer who covers culture, politics, and mental health through a Black feminist lens.
