COMMENT BELOW</b></p><p>Dr Yadu Singh, the President of one of the country's Australian Indian Associations, also recognises that the traditional Indian approach to service has not always worked well in Australia's taxis.</p><p>"Indians generally will keep to themselves. They will do the job and do it politely," he said.</p><p>"They are not psychologists, they are not counsellors, so they don't actually start a dialogue. However, they will take part in a dialogue if the other person is doing it."</p><p>Conversation aside, the taxi industry has had to tighten regulations to improve the basic skills of this large influx of new drivers.</p><p>"Without a doubt it took the industry a while to adjust to the influx of Indian taxi drivers," said Mr Davies.</p><p>"They were coming into the industry with a different skillset and we needed to adjust the training programs to build on the strengths that they had and address any weaknesses."</p><p>The Australian taxi industry alongside the state regulatory bodies has now introduced greater standards of English language testing, improved the driving skill component in training courses and required drivers to hold a local drivers license for at least a year.</p><p>The rise in Indian taxi drivers - from around 2000 in 2006 to more than 6000 in 2011 - is partly attributed to Australia's success in attracting Indian students to its education system.</p><p>"The reasons are probably linked to education," said David Chalke, social analyst and consultant to AustraliaSCAN.</p><p>"There's been a big push to sell education in Australia to the subcontinent which has produced a large number of subcontinent students looking to make a bit of money on the side."</p><p>As a result, an Indian-speaking taxi driver is more likely to have finished high school than an English-speaking one, according to ABS Census data.</p><p>"There aren't necessarily the jobs available in the area (in which the student graduated) so they end up taxi driving. A lot of those education visas were those that allow you to graduate and then work," said Mr Chalke.</p><p>Between 2006 and 2011, Australian-born automobile drivers - made up of taxi and chauffeur drivers - declined by around 1400, while Indian-born drivers increased by more than 4000 according to the ABS Census.</p><p>Sometime in the next year, Indian-born automobile drivers are scheduled to outnumber drivers who are Australian-born.</p><p>The shift is significant. As a comparison, in 1966 there were a relatively high number of UK-born manufacturing workers in Australia. Yet Australian-born manufacturing workers still outnumbered Brits more than five-to-one.</p><p>The pattern around Indian taxi drivers is more pronounced in some areas of Australia than others.</p><p>South Australia and Victoria are already home to more Indian-born cabbies.</p><p>"(Indian drivers) have tended to aggregate in some cities rather than others," said Mr Chalke.</p><p>"It's been less in Brisbane for example than it has been in Melbourne."</p><p>Alongside automobile drivers and workers in the textile industry, housekeepers and chefs are also among the occupations with the highest proportions of overseas-born workers.</p><p>"If you're a recent migrant and you've got poor English and all you can do is work a sewing machine, well that's probably where you're going to end up," said Mr Chalke.</p><p>Yet not all migrants have found footholds only in low-paying industries.</p><p>Foreign-born workers also represent more than half of all GPs and dental practitioners.</p><p><b>Top 10 jobs with highest proportion of overseas-born workers</b></p><p>Automobile Drivers</p><p>Sewing Machinists</p><p>Clothing Trades Workers</p><p>Generalist Medical Practitioners</p><p>Dental Practitioners</p><p>Software and Applications Programmers</p><p>Social Professionals</p><p>ICT Support and Test Engineers</p><p>Housekeepers</p><p>Chefs</p><p><i>Source: ABS Census 2011</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmny4u9GkZqKmlJ6ur3nTmq%2BiZZSntrex0axkraddpMK1utSmmZ6qXZbCtMDRmqOimZ6XvLO6jJqZrGeemsS0edKtpquxX5qEcrDEamifmZOXgHF9kWydaZlkl7OmhZWabXCdYG6v</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./no-make-up-look-come-si-fa-fendi.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Il no-makeup look alla sfilata di Fendi Couture Estate 2024</span></a>
