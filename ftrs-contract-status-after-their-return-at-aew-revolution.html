The duo made their presence known by attacking The Gunns following their successful World Tag Team Championship defense at the pay-per-view event.</p><p>According to a new report from <a href=#>PWInsider</a>, it seems that FTR’s absence from AEW programming was merely a storyline situation. The belief backstage is that the tag team has long-term deals with AEW. This revelation comes as a relief for fans who were worried that FTR’s return was only temporary.</p><p>This news may not come as a surprise to some, as <a href=#>Dax Harwood hinted at the possibility of hiatus during an episode of his podcast in January</a>. He stated that their contracts were set to expire in April, and that they may be away until then, or possibly even longer.</p><p>Harwood said, “That’s my news; we’re going to be away for a little while. I’m not sure exactly how long we’ll be away. It may be all the way up until the end of our contract. I don’t know yet; contract is up in April. I’m not exactly sure on the exact date, our gimmick attorney would know that. But it will be somewhere in the beginning of April.”</p><p>Fans will surely be excited to hear that FTR’s return to AEW is permanent, and that they will continue to be a dominant force in the tag team division. It remains to be seen what the future holds for the duo, but one thing is for certain: they are back, and they mean business.</p><p>What are your thoughts on FTR’s return to AEW TV and their reported long-term contracts with the company?
