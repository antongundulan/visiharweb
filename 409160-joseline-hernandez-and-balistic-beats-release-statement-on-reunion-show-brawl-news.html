The provocative Zeus network series has been a favorite for those who have closely followed Joseline Hernandez's career from Love & Hip Hop to becoming a producer of her own show. Her fiancé Balistic Beats has been by her side but according to Amber Ali,&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the couple unleashed a violent attack</a> while filming the reunion.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Ali took to social media to show that she was being treated for her injuries in a hospital. She claimed that Hernandez kicked and punched her, and added that Balistic grabbed her by her hair and ripped it from her scalp.&nbsp;</p><p>Bryan Steffy / Stringer / Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Hernandez took to Twitter to suggest that the women on her show work for her until they die&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">and seemed unapologetic</a> about whatever took place during taping. Other women who were at the scene also shared their takes on what&nbsp;occurred and confirmed that the fight was serious. The Zeus network issued a formal statement saying they condemn unprovoked violence and now, Hernandez and Balistic have shared a joint statement of their own.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"We are deeply saddened by the accusations made against our family at the Joseline's Cabaret Reunion," the statement began. "We would like to thank our fans for their continued support. Joseline is the mother of a five-year-old girl and would never take any action to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">jeopardize her family</a>." It went on to say that the show's foundation is "female empowerment" and its purpose is to uplift women.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">They denied that they participated in bullying to unprovoked violence and claimed that the footage will support their stance.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"In a time when social media narratives easily get misconstrued, we believe our family's response<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> is being silenced</a> by the facilitated deletion of both Joseline's Instagram and Facebook accounts."
