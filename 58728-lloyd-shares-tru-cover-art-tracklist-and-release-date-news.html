The song shed some light on all of the pain behind his hiatus and introduced a new artist who is set on using his longtime craft as a means to find his place in the world. His renewed spirit was deeply moving, and "Tru" was about as impressive a return as one could have imagined. It turns out that "Tru" will be the titular track off his comeback project, a 5-track EP that is set to arrive on Dec. 9. Lloyd recently shared the&nbsp;<strong>Tru&nbsp;</strong>tracklist as well as the EP's cover artwork, which shows him sitting naked on a rock situated in the path of a gentle waterfall.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The excellent <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>2 Chainz</a>-featuring <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">remix</a>&nbsp;of "Tru," released earlier this month, will appear as a bonus track on the EP. The release will contain three brand new tracks, including "Heavenly Body," featuring <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rick Ross</a>, the lone guest on <strong>Tru</strong>. Upon sharing the <strong>Tru&nbsp;</strong>artwork on Instagram, Lloyd wrote a lengthy statement on the meaning of the nude photo as well as his goals for the EP.
