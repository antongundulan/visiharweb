The beef got incredibly ugly, especially after Ace and Foolio traded&nbsp;diss songs in "Who I Smoke" and "When I See You." The two artists got some viral success from the beef, and now, they are each dropping their own projects. After dropping&nbsp;Love Me Like I'm Dead back in November of 2020, Foolio has returned with&nbsp;Love Me Like I'm Dead (Last Call)&nbsp;which is a deluxe project of sorts that adds 12 new tracks, including "Whip Bump."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">With these 12 new tracks, Foolio showcases his versatility as he offers a plethora of different sounds. From catchy bubbly tunes to more sinister gang-related tracks, Foolio pulls out all of the tricks with this deluxe album. For those who got introduced to Foolio through his diss tracks, this album will serve as a solid reminder of what Foolio can do on a song when he's not focused on one person in particular.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It's yet another solid effort from the young artist, and you can stream it, below.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
