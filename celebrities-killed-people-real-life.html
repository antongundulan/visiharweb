With a hit TV show and a popular stage act, Cooley's fame at the time was recognized when he was awarded his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Cooley's fans, however, were none the wiser that the self-proclaimed King of Western Swing was a pill-popping alcoholic with a mean streak, who habitually beat both his first and second wives.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1961, Cooley's second wife, Ella Mae, was in the process of divorcing him. Suspicious that she was cheating on him, Cooley&nbsp;savagely beat her to death, over the course of several hours, even torturing her with lit cigarettes —&nbsp;all while forcing their teenage daughter to watch. According to <a href=#>SFGate</a>, the trial was sensational, with Cooley initially claiming insanity before changing his plea.</p><p>He received a life sentence (via <a href=#>FindLaw</a>). Cooley proved to be a model prisoner, and was granted parole after just nine years. Shortly before his release, Cooley was given a 72-hour furlough so he could perform at a concert. After his final number was met with enthusiastic applause, Cooley walked backstage, collapsed, and died of a massive heart attack.&nbsp;Spade Cooley's star can still be found on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know needs help with addiction issues, help is available.
