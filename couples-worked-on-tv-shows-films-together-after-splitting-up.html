Five months later, the pair ended their relationship which Sophia has since said was down to being "22 and stupid", adding that the producers were&nbsp;&nbsp;"deeply inappropriate to both of us" following their split.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:center id=eCReaEdwtZRg data-wc=13><strong>WATCH:&nbsp;Sophia Bush and Chad Michael Murray were married while filming the show</strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=ebwjaLSvtFkn data-wc=39>The pair worked together following their break, with a scene even depicting Lucas proposing to Brooke in an imagined scenario.

You can put a positive or a negative skew on it. But I was always going to put Brooke Davis ahead of everybody and everything else. Nothing mattered to me but being honest for her."</p><h2>Joey King and Jacob Elordi&nbsp;</h2><p id=e4Kbf5FsVnhE data-wc=66>Joey and Jacob dated while making the&nbsp;movies, and continued to work together following their split in 2019. Speaking about the situation while chatting on the podcast Mood with Lauren Elizabeth, she called it a "wild experience", adding: "It was a really beautiful time. Because I learned a lot about myself and I grew as an actor. I grew as a person on this."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cf2a961daf85-jacob-joey-z.jpg><h2>Lili Reinhart and Cole Sprouse</h2><p id=e6_EeT3vRxzw data-wc=42>Lili and Cole dating while filming the hit show Riverdale since 2017, finally<a class=hm-link href=#> ending their relationship in August 2020. </a>Speaking about working together following the split on the Call Her Daddy podcast, Cole explained: "It was really hard. It was really hard for both of us. And that’s okay."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/84148243a011-lili-cole-z.jpg><p id=eztfadqqqVKf data-wc=47>He continued: "The work thing got difficult because it was hard to suspend all of the ways we felt about each other, and it didn’t afford us the luxury of distance to overcome that. I know we both did quite a bit of damage to each other."&nbsp;</p><p id=en7TxQGqEBYc data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Is Daisy Jones and the Six based on true story?</a></strong></p><h2>Nicholas Hoult and Jennifer Lawrence</h2><p id=eeyev0FzP2v6 data-wc=67>Nicholas and Jennifer dated for several years after meeting on the set of the X-Men films, eventually <a class=hm-link href=#>calling it quits</a> with an amicable break-up in 2014. Speaking about their working relationship, Nicholas told the Evening Standard back in 2019: "We're a big family. We've been doing those movies since we were 20 years old. As much as the&nbsp;Skins&nbsp;crowd grew up together, the&nbsp;X-Men&nbsp;crowd really grew up together.&nbsp;</p><p id=eTWPledFSwC1 data-wc=22>"It’s been a good eight, nine years making those movies. We've all got to get along. We've all got to have fun."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/16c524e86042-jennifer-nicholas-z.jpg><h2>Hayden Panettiere and Milo Ventimiglia</h2><p id=eCYLp6NuGkFT data-wc=98>The pair got together while working together on the set of Heroes, where <a class=hm-link href=#>Milo’s character Peter Petrelli</a> was told he had to save a cheerleader to save the world (the cheerleader being Hayden’s character, Claire). After their split, Milo revealed that he would "never again" embark on a relationship with a co-star. He told Mr Porter:&nbsp;"There are things that happen to you in your life that shape who you are. Everything I've been through from jobs to friendships to partnerships — everything has built me to who I am. You learn from it. You learn a better way of doing things."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c04c86986f0e-hayden-milo-z.jpg><h2>Penn Badgley and Blake Lively&nbsp;</h2><p id=eMjR9dgBYx2h data-wc=80>Penn and Blake AKA Dan and Serena dated for three years while filming Gossip Girl together, with <a class=hm-link href=#>Penn speaking highly of his co-star </a>and their working relationship after they called it quits. Chatting to Elle back in 2013, he said: "We were very much caught up in the show, which itself was a six-year endurance test. Our relationship was a part of that and helped us through it. I mean, like anything valuable, it was good and it was bad and it was a learning experience."</p><p id=euYMAbp7IiXr data-wc=53>He later joked about having <a class=hm-link href=#>to kiss Blake on set </a>following their split while appearing on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When asked who he liked kissing onscreen the most, he said: "I’ll say it was Blake, because we actually had a relationship at the time. [My worst kiss is] maybe Blake after we broke up."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6572f75573d6-blake-lively-penn-badgly-z.jpg><h2>Michael C Hall and Jennifer Carpenter</h2><p id=efGZJQn9NeZj data-wc=77>While playing adoptive brother and sister on the show, the pair got together and tied the knot in real life, and were married for two years before divorcing in 2011 - all while the show was still filming. Speaking about their split at a PaleyFest event in 2013, Jennifer said: "Our marriage didn't look like anyone else's, and our divorce didn't either. I said it before — just because the marriage ended doesn't mean the love did."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6fb9f0c9345d-michael-jennifer-z.jpg><h2>Madelyn Cline and Chase Stokes</h2><p id=eO_qehNpsFIT data-wc=99>The Outer Banks co-stars dated during seasons one and two of the show but called it quits before making season three. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly about the split, Chase said: "Mads and I have been working together now for 30 episodes, and we made a promise to each other before we even started dating that the work was always going to come first. And that no matter what happens in our personal lives, and the ways that life sometimes takes you in different directions, we're always going to honour the work. That stayed 100 per cent truthful this season."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d862ac853aec-chase-madelyn-z.jpg><h2>Dominic Cooper and Amanda Seyfried&nbsp;</h2><p id=eG1ucih2Hs0K data-wc=74>Although the couple were dating during the 2008 film&nbsp;the pair parted way ahead of the sequel&nbsp;and Amanda revealed that her husband Thomas Sadoski was not best pleased. She explained: "I'd guess he assumed Dominic is in love with me the way he's in love with me. And it's just not the case, it's sweet. I’d rather he be jealous than completely fine with it."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bbd63b4fda78-amanda-dominic-z.jpg><p id=enSuuX30muwP data-wc=15></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
