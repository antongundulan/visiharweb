"Linda and I met in the 10th grade so we have known each other since we were 15," he recalled.

Frick Award in 2021</a> — he told SI that Linda is "the biggest piece of luck" he's had in his life and said that she's the only one who knows him the best. But besides falling in love at an early age, the couple also worked together when Al started out in broadcasting, learning under the guidance of famed game show host Chuck Barris.</p><p dir=ltr>Al's first job was being an office boy under Barris and helped pick the women who appeared on "The Dating Game," according to the <a href=# one-link-mark=yes>Los Angeles Times</a>. Meanwhile, Linda worked as the assistant prize coordinator on "The Newlywed Game" — another Barris creation — which was fitting as the two had just gotten married in 1966. However, working together is just one of their preferred ways of spending time with each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG5jZYB5e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2WuW65yJyfmp2cqHq4tcWeZKWhnpmucA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./coastal-cowgirl-aesthetic.html><span>←</span><span>The fashion set is reviving the coastal cowgirl trend for 2024</span></a>
