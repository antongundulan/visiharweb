The mother of one adorns her hourglass figure in <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">skintight outfits</a>. Many of them leave little to the imagination as she twerks away and raps some of her biggest hits. Earlier this week, Azalea was performing in Saudi Arabia. She opted to tone down her usual antics, but still found herself in hot water with local authorities after suffering from a serious wardrobe malfunction on stage.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In a video making rounds online, the blonde beauty confidently dances along with her entourage when the latex material of her pants suddenly splits on her left thigh. There's an obvious moment of panic that flashes across Azalea's face. Still, she ultimately handled the awkward moment as best as she could, continuing to sing into the microphone while doing her best to hide the exposed skin. Eventually, someone from the foreigner's team was able to bring her a new pair of bottoms. Nevertheless, after getting a few more songs out, Iggy's concert was shut down.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-iggy-azalea-handles-saudi-arabia-slip-like-a-pro>Iggy Azalea Handles Saudi Arabia Slip Like a Pro</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Saudi Arabia please know to everyone at the show tonight… I LOVE YOU!!! And I'm soooooo sorry I wasn't allowed to finish my show," Iggy tweeted out to fans earlier this weekend. "It's not the promoter who put on the show's fault so show them kindness because they are amazing people and we all wanted to continue but were not allowed by authorities because of my pants splitting."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">When someone asked if Azalea changing her pants wasn't enough to satisfy the police, she revealed that her messages of feminism apparently sent them over the edge. "I said, "Ladies make some noise, it’s a woman's world!" And apparently that sent the authorities over the edge. Lol," she dished.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-rap-diva-chats-with-fans-on-twitter-about-the-incident>Rap Diva Chats with Fans on Twitter About the Incident</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Keep scrolling to see what Iggy Azalea had to say about her Saudi Arabian concert ending early on Twitter yesterday.
