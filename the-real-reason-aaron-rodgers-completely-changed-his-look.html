The athlete starred as Wick with his hands on the pooch's face and tagged teammate David Bakhtiari in the October 31 upload.</p><p>But that wasn't all. You didn't think he'd go through all that trouble just for one photo did you? Rodgers followed up with another <a href=#>Instagram</a> post in which he showed off multiple poses, including flashing a fake gun and running with the dog. He included a few snaps of Reeves in character to show just how much he resembled Wick, writing in the caption, "I'm thinking I'm back... Para Bellum."</p><p>Rodgers revealed his long locks were for a costume in September, saying on <a href=#>"The Pat McAfee Show,"</a> "I have a month-ish until Halloween and this has been a year in the making for my costume." He added the person he was dressing as was "a hero of his," but kept the rest a mystery... until now, of course.</p><p>Judging by all that effort, we have to say it was worth the wait.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2xpaIZ5e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2WrrO7zWapqJyXmr%2B0ecKopKmklamyrcWMnJ%2BappeasW60yKxkpaefoHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-sex-card-games.html><span>←</span><span>The 12 Best Sex Card Games, According to Sex Experts</span></a>
