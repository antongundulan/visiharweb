In fact, fans still aren't sure where they stand in 2021. The couple, who have been dating on and off since 2016 (per <a href=#>The Sun</a>), met after they "finally crossed paths" when she moved to Atlanta.&nbsp;"We&nbsp;just started vibing," Cheaves explained in <a href=#>June 2018 interview</a>. "It's pretty serious ... It will be two years coming up really soon."</p><p>The rapper, whose real name is Dominique Jones, and the Instagram model later welcomed a son named Loyal in 2019, per <a href=#>XXL Mag</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, the pair seemingly called it quits in February 2021 after Cheaves hinted that she was single on Instagram. "I've been in relationships my whole life since high school I don't even know how to be single," she wrote (via&nbsp;<a href=#>Hot New Hip Hop</a>). "I need to learn myself all over again." According to <a href=#>The Shade Room</a>, Cheaves also discussed love and relationships, admitting that not everything is as it seems. "Beyond all the glitz and the glam, this s**t real life," she shared. "I go through the same s**t y'all go through, even worse s**t y'all go through. Like we all human at the end of the day. And we all got f***in' problems."</p><p>Keep scrolling to find out the truth about Lil Baby and Cheaves' relationship, including the musician's history with infidelity.</p><h2>Lil Baby said he wasn't 'in love' with Jayda Cheaves</h2><p>After welcoming their son, Lil Baby and Jayda Cheaves hit a rough patch in their relationship in early 2020. The rapper publicly admitted he wasn't "deeply in love" with anyone and insinuated that he wasn't taking his relationship with the model seriously, per <a href=#>The Shade Room</a>.</p><p>At the time, Cheaves responded to his comments via Instagram and confirmed they had broken up.&nbsp;"Stop trying to piece together this man interviews, songs etc because we're no longer in a relationship," she wrote in a since-deleted tweet (via&nbsp;Superstar News). "We're also not beefing so. It's no bad blood on my end. ... the main focus right now is that we have a 1 year old to raise. That's it. That's all."</p><p>The couple later seemingly confirmed they were back together in May after Cheaves shared a <a href=#>photo</a> of her and Lil Baby kissing.</p><h2>Lil Baby has been accused of cheating multiple times</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/the-truth-about-lil-baby-and-jayda-cheaves-relationship/lil-baby-has-been-accused-of-cheating-multiple-times-1621019707.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</span><p>Throughout Lil Baby and <a href=#>Jayda Cheaves</a>' relationship, the rapper may have been unfaithful more than once. First, in 2018, he&nbsp;seemingly admitted to cheating on the model&nbsp;with the mother of his oldest son, per <a href=#>Vlad&nbsp;TV</a>,&nbsp;right before they announced they were having a baby. Then, in&nbsp;December 2020, <a href=#>Lil Baby&nbsp;was accused of cheating</a> on Cheaves with a porn star named Ms. London, who alleged the rapper&nbsp;paid her $6,000 to sleep with him, according to <a href=#>The Sun</a>.</p><p>Soon after, in February, Cheaves publicly put an end to her relationship with Lil Baby, but they continue to co-parent their son, Loyal. The rapper even spoiled his baby's mom on Mother's Day by decorating the house with flowers and candles, as well as gifting her with&nbsp;Birkin Bags and a new car, per <a href=#>The Shade Room</a>.</p><p>It's unclear if they've rekindled their romance once again, however, Lil Baby has said in the past that he and Cheaves will always have a special connection. "It ain't no like, 'still together.' She my son mama, so it ain't no way we cannot be together," he <a href=#>explained</a>. "Even if we not in a relationship like boyfriend and girlfriend type s**t, we got a relationship because we got a kid. We got a small kid so... we gotta kick it no matter what."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWlga4V3e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2htq15wZqZsmWRo7FutsCym5plk52yosLErGSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-bonerowski-palace-hotel.html><span>←</span><span>The Bonerowski Palace Hotel Review, Krakw, Poland</span></a>
