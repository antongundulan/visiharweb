He's continued to experiment further and further with each project but this one could be his most experimental thusfar. With "Pineapple Skies," Miguel brings his silky smooth vocal talents over 80's inspired production. It doesn't have the "banger" appeal as the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Travis Scott</a> assisted "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Sky Walker</a>" but it's&nbsp;another song that fits into what Miguel does best. He initally teased the song with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Snoop Dogg</a> on his GGN online series.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">With a little over two weeks to go, Miguel's War & Leisure album is set to drop on December 1st. Basing on what he's dropped so far, he may end up contending for a spot on a year-end list.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics<br></strong></span>Everything gon' be alright<br>Got you dancin' to the song while you do it like that<br>Lights so bright,<br>How you do it like that?</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
