The letter emphasized not only the heightened security risk his public monitoring poses for Taylor, but also the "constant state of fear for her personal safety".&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Taylor Swift makes Grammys history with fourth Album of the Year win as Miley Cyrus and SZA win big" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/fe4e5758e47c-grammys-winners.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Taylor Swift makes Grammys history with fourth Album of the Year win as Miley Cyrus and SZA win big" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Taylor Swift makes Grammys history with fourth Album of the Year win as Miley Cyrus and SZA win big</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ac70ee20518a-taylor-swift-eras-tour-brazil.jpg><p id=e7SpDKz1sj data-wc=44>Taylor's spokeswoman maintained to the<strong>&nbsp;Washington Post,&nbsp;</strong>who first reported on the private jet issue: "We cannot comment on any ongoing police investigation but can confirm the timing of stalkers suggests a connection.
