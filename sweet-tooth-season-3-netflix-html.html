The recently released second season just hit the streamer to favorable reviews, and it seems like we’ll be getting one last batch of episodes. The official <a href=#>Twitter</a> page for the series took to the social media platform to announce that Sweet Tooth Season 3 is coming and that it would be the show’s last:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>With a planned end to the series, it seems like fans will at least rest assured that they’ll get closure with Sweet Tooth Season 3 rather than the show facing an untimely end like so many other Netflix originals. For those who haven’t tuned in yet, Sweet Tooth is a <a href=#>post-apocalyptic</a> fantasy drama that is based on the comic book of the same name by Jeff Lemire. The series takes place in a world that sees most of humanity wiped out by a virus, leading to some hybrid animals and humans being born.</p><p>The show follows a half-human half-deer boy named Gus, who sets out to find his mother after his father dies. The series stars Nonso Anozie,&nbsp;Christian Convery,&nbsp;Adeel Akhtar,&nbsp;Stefania LaVie Owen, and&nbsp;Dania Ramirez. With both seasons drawing critical acclaim so far, hopefully, Sweet Tooth Season 3 will bring the show to a satisfying conclusion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sweet-tooth-netflix-900x600.jpg><p>We also know that Sweet Tooth Season 3 has already completed filming in New Zealand. <a href=#>Variety</a> also reported on some comments from showrunner and executive producer Jim Mickle, who revealed that an Artic adventure will be part of the final season. The cast list is also going through some changes as Rosalind Chao and My Seimetz, who play Zhao and Birde, respectively, will be upgraded to series regulars.</p><p>New cast members for Sweet Tooth Season 3 include Cara Gee and Ayazhan Dalabeyeva, who will star as Siana and Nuka. Mickle will also serve as director for the season with Beth Schwartz, Susan Downey, <a href=#>Robert Downey Jr.</a>, Evan Moore, Amanda Burrell, and Linda Moran executive producing. Mickle will also be on as executive producer again.</p><p>It’s not surprising that Netflix was willing to greenlight Sweet Tooth Season 3, as the critical acclaim for the second season came in addition to the reported 48.3 million hours viewed during its first four days of release. The show is also currently sitting at #1 on the top ten <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=streaming data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>streaming</a> shows on Netflix today, which it will presumably hold on to for the time being. It remains to be seen how long it will hold on, though it’s certainly possible the <a href=#>Bridgerton</a> spin-off Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story releasing on May 4 could knock it off.</p><p>Season 2 of the series saw a new wave of the virus bear down on humanity, with Gus and his fellow hybrid held captive to possibly find a cure. The season explores more of Gus’s origins along with his mother’s possible role in the Great Crumble. There’s no word yet on when we can expect to see Sweet Tooth Season 3 premiere, but we’ll be sure to keep you updated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irp5qytXnTqKatoF2osqK%2FzqdkbGWemsGnuMixZaGsnaE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sophia-thomalla-net-worth-185680.html><span>←</span><span>Sophia Thomalla Net Worth</span></a>
