In fact, some of the stories they wrote in In The Hope We Hold are so intimate that their own families were not aware of them before reading the book. "It kind of just walks through our journey through life," <a href=#>Jinger said</a> in the Instagram Live. "And so it starts with our childhoods and talk[s] about how I grew up," she continued. "We hope to just give some amazing stories that you guys haven't heard — some that you might know about — but then some that definitely you haven't heard."</p><p dir=ltr>Jeremy then chimed in, confirming that the stories are definitely unique. "As we let our families read some of the stories, they were saying, 'Man, we didn't know that about you guys,'" he said, with a grin on his face.</p><p dir=ltr>Jinger and Jeremy Vuolo are clearly excited to have their fans get a deeper look into their daily lives, and fans certainly are too. The comment section under the video quickly filled up with positive notes from fans expressing how eager they are to get their hands on the new project. "Looking forward to reading your book!" one fan exclaimed. Another said they already pre-ordered it. An additional fan was happy to see the Vuolos doing so well. "You guys look absolutely amazing so good to see those beautiful faces!!!" they exclaimed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG9oZYRxe8inqqKclWK3qrrGnqlmmZ6Zequx0Z6ksmWmqrytu9JmpZ6vXZe8sLeO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hugh-jackman-54-deborra-lee-67-turn-heads-as-they-step-out-at-wimbledon-final.html><span>←</span><span>Hugh Jackman, 54, Deborra-Lee, 67 turn heads as they step out at Wimbledon final</span></a>
