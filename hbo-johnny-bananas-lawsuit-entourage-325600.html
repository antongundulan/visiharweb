The episodes in question started airing on Aug. 15, 2010, and Devenanzio didn’t bring the claim until Oct. 3, 2011. The one-year statute of limitations window had closed, so the judge finds the lawsuit to be less “Johnny Bananas” and more “Johnny Rotten.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>VIDEO: ‘Entourage’ Roundtable</a></strong></p><p>The judge also adds, “In any event, the telecast, even if repeated, does not constitute atrocious, indecent or utterly despicable conduct meeting the requirements for an intentional emotional distress claim.”</p><p>Devenanzio was represented in this action by <strong>Stephanie Ovadia</strong>, who has also represented <strong>Lindsay Lohan</strong> in publicity rights claims and has been accused of making <a href=#>strange court filings</a>.</p><p>HBO was represented by attorneys at Levine Sullivan Koch & Schulz.</p><p>Johnny Bananas was the character and title of an animation series in Entourage that featured apes and monkeys. At one point, there were rumors of a spinoff.</p><p>E-mail: eriq.gardner@thr.com</p><p>Twitter: @eriqgardner</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmoZqfYrewtM2nsGaakaOur63SZqOar6OqtrV5xKerqK2ilrSmeZJrbG9oYGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./garth-brooks-welcomes-first-grandchild-594441.html><span>←</span><span>Garth Brooks Welcomes First Grandchild The Hollywood Reporter</span></a>
