If I’m being completely honest with you, I was like, ‘I’m going to jump the gun here’.</p><p>“I’m a passive dude, but when it comes to my music and my business, I’m serious about it and I’m competitive, so I wanted to be the first to go and do my own thing. That was the reason.”</p><p>He also revealed that there were underlying tensions between band members who had been battling the pressures of fame for five years since their debut on British talent show the X-Factor.</p><p>“There was obviously underlying issues within our friendships, too. We’d got sick of each other if I’m being completely honest.”</p><p>The star was speaking ahead of the release of his comeback single Love Like This on 21 July.</p><p>The star also addressed the 2021 incident in which he was accused of harassing his ex-girlfriend, the supermodel Gigi Hadid, and her mother Yolanda.</p><p>The star pleaded no contest to four charges of harassment following a family argument, in which he was alleged to have grabbed and shoved Yolanda.</p><p>He later issued a statement in which he denied hitting the elder Hadid (no charges were filed relating to this accusation) and said he had agreed not to contest the harassment charges so he could concentrate on raising his daughter, Khai, with his ex-partner.</p><p>“I just didn’t want to bring attention to anything,” Zayn said.</p><p>“I just wasn’t trying to get into a negative back and forth with her [Yolanda], or any sort of narrative online where my daughter was going to look back and read that. There was no point.</p><p>“I believe I dealt with it in the best way, an amicable, respectful way, and that’s all that needs to be said.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2ilpai2pHvZmrCnZZ2Wuaq3jKucr52RocBuvsSaqqimo2KvprTIp5tmoJmoeqWxz5qpra2imnqnvs6mZKimlWKxqr7EnKuip55is7C%2BjK2fnmWWnr%2B0wIytoKadX6OyuL%2BMrKuoqqlkr6exwZ9ubZxlmH5xfI%2BcnJuaZZqBeH%2FAmmlrnmKWhHI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-they-cut-off-kunta-kinte-foot-html.html><span>←</span><span>Why did they cut off Kunta Kinte foot?</span></a>
