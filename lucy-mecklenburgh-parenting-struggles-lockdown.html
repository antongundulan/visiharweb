"It's really important to share the good, the bad and the ugly on social media. Of course you can share gorgeous pictures but I also think it’s really important to show real mum life, like getting zero hours sleep, having to function the next day and juggling work with being a full-time mum. Sharing every aspect gives so much support to other mums who might have become disillusioned seeing accounts that look so perfect all the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f3629d8d3b98-lucy-mecklenburgh-baby-roman-parenting-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e58OvASjZJQM data-wc=13><strong>Ex-TOWIE star Lucy Mecklenburgh does a Results Wellness Lifestyle workout with baby Roman</strong></p><p id=edhnTTYJE4rS data-wc=66>"Roman turned things upside down for me, so if there’s a sleep deprived mum that’s feeling a bit down, looking at my honest Instagram post could change the rest of the day.
