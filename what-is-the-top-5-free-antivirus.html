Features and pricing differ slightly in that Avast offers a few extras at the premium level. AVG is credited with a better user interface, and its top-tier plan costs a bit less than Avast's.<h2>Which is better Avira or Avast?</h2>Avira is somewhat better on macOS, while Avast has some edge on Windows and Android. They both are ranked with Top product certificates. As for AV-comparatives, they found out that Avast has a better offline detection rate, and detects fewer false positives.

If you want the best protection in 2022, go with Norton. McAfee is more intuitive and has better customer support than Norton. If you want a secure, feature-rich, and beginner-friendly internet security suite, go with McAfee.<h2>Is Kaspersky better than Norton?</h2>In conclusion, both Norton and Kaspersky are great contenders for the ideal antivirus software.
