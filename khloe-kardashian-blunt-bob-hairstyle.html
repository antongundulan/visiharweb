Taking to Instagram, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star has debuted her chic blunt bob to the world and we love it.</p><p id=eP_G0xF6FJv data-wc=65><a class=hm-link href=#>Khloe</a> is no stranger to a bob haircut, but the last time she had it, it was more tousled and care-free - now she means business with razor-sharp ends. The 34-year-old is the latest star to jump on this summer’s short-hair trend. <a class=hm-link href=#>Rihanna</a>, Lucy Hale, Jessica Chastain and <a class=hm-link href=#>Mollie King</a> are all reaching for the scissors - though thankfully they have trusted stylists to do it for them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/49597523655e-khloe-kardashian-bob-z.jpg><p id=evuJ--SjUWt0 data-wc=2><strong>CHOP CHOP! <a class=hm-link href=#>These are the stars rocking super-short bobs&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p id=ej_duh6v7yeK data-wc=115>The man responsible for Khloe’s new ‘do is her super-stylist Andrew Fitzsimons&nbsp;- he&nbsp;chopped Khlo’s hair into a blunt bob and ironed it straight using hair straighteners. Now, he's told <strong>HELLO! </strong>exactly how the transformation came about - and how he created the look. "Khloe has been thinking about bringing the 'Koko bob'&nbsp;back for a bit," he said.&nbsp;"It all really started when we were shooting the Good American campaign recently; on campaigns we usually do a bunch of different looks and lengths to mirror the style of the looks. For this campaign, we shot activewear, so we decided to bring back the “Koko bob” that she hasn’t had since before her pregnancy."</p><p id=eagloGUIvH7R data-wc=109>It turns out, the new mum actually experimented with wigs before she actually took the plunge. "After testing out some faux bobs over the past couple of weeks, we finally did the big chop on Sunday before the City of Hope charity poker tournament," he said. And what about styling? "One of the things people don’t love about bobs is not being able to tie them back to get the hair out of your face—especially in the summer. The trick’s with Khloe’s cut is that it’s tapered to be longer in the front, so it’s just long enough to be pulled back into a ponytail (perfect for working out!)."</p><p id=elt8WEs4hMsW data-wc=1><strong>REVEALED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>The REAL reason Princess Diana didn't want anyone to know about her haircuts</a></strong></p><p id=enKHRyHQ6Ea3 data-wc=73>And, if you are considering&nbsp;taking the plunge - wigs are the way forward. "If you’re thinking about a bob and it’s a big change from your current length, I highly recommend getting a wig to test out the style before you make the chop. Wigs are a fun way to make sure that you’re happy with the new length and allows you to 'test run'&nbsp;the style before fully committing," Andrew adds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BaoaJkf3F9l2lua29lZYN0hI6kn6WnlWK4or7DmqqhoZGjeqO41KerZpqfl3qprcirqq2xnJp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kari-jobe-age-wikipedia-biography-height-weight-net-worth-in-2021-and-more-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kari Jobe Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Height, Weight, Net Worth in 2021 and more</span></a>
