She's so into bags that she granted her favorite brand, Launer, a royal warrant, "the ultimate seal of approval and prestige" for brands who supply products for the royal family, the <a href=#>website</a> states. So what does the queen carry around in these illustrious bags? Phil Dampier, an author who has covered the royal family for decades, told <a href=#>Hello!</a>&nbsp;that the queen carries her reading glasses, a pen, treats for her corgis (!), a compact mirror, and a handkerchief.

Marcia Moody, who wrote the 2013 book "Kate: A Biography," said that the duchess never leaves home without lip balm, a handkerchief, a compact mirror, and blotting papers to take care of any excessive shine (via <a href=#>Glamour</a>). Sounds like Kate is pretty adept at watching and learning from her royal predecessor.</p><p dir=ltr>Unlike the queen though, Kate hasn't attached to one brand for her bags, a later publication by <a href=#>Hello!</a>&nbsp;notes.

Clearly, she likes to keep her options open when it comes to bags.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb29lZYN6e8eormajkamybrnInZulnaSku7R5xqWYpqelp3qprdJmnK%2BnnKuypXnOr5yrZaSdsm7FxJqprGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heather-graham-best-bikini-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Heather Graham's five most sizzling bikini looks at 53 see gorgeous photos</span></a>
