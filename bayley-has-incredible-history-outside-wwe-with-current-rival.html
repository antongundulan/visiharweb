That is certainly the case, as <a href=#>Bayley and Shotzi Blackheart apparently share connection that few knew about.</a></p><p>Bayley and Shotzi are currently engaged in a feud on WWE television. Bayley even cut off Shotzi’s hair, which led Shotzi to do her own shave job, one which paid tribute to her own sister. Their history went back a lot further than just that angle.</p><p><a href=#>The Wrestling Observer Newsletter </a>noted that Bayley and Shotzi actually went to high school together. Bayley is a bit older, but that history and connection is still notable.</p><p>Shotzi (Ashley Urbanski, 31), also got engaged over the past weekend. I didn’t know this, although I knew both were from San Jose, but Shotzi and Bayley both went to the same high school (Independence High). Bayley is three years older</p><p>We will have to see what is next for everyone involved. Bayley just suffered an injury as well, and we have not heard anything about that prognosis. Hopefully, Bayley’s injury status isn’t so bad that it keeps her out of work for another extended period of time.</p><p>Shotzi also just shaved her head for that storyline with Bayley. Only time will tell how that angle pans out, especially with so much uncertainty in the situation.</p><p>What’s your take on this story about Bayley and Shotzi?
