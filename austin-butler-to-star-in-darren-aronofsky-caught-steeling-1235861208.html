In Dune: Part Two, Butler earned a strong reaction for his work as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, the psychotic villain who goes toe-to-toe with Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides. Coming up, he has 1960s motorcycle drama The Bikeriders out in June. On the small screen, he recently starred in the World War II aviation drama Masters of the Air for Apple TV+.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">For Butler, the Caught Stealing teams him with yet another auteur after working with Dune 2’s Denis Villeneuve and Elvis’ Lurhmann. Aronofsky was last in theaters with 2022’s The Whale, which landed Brendan Fraser a best actor Oscar win in the year Butler was also nominated.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I am excited to be teaming up with my old friends at Sony Pictures to bring Charlie’s adrenaline-soaked roller-coaster ride to life. I can’t wait to start working with Austin and my family of NYC filmmakers,” said Aronofsky.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Sony has a number of high-profile projects in the works, including Sam Mendes’ four-picture Beatles biopics and Danny Boyle’s 28 Years Later.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Darren is one of the most brilliant audiovisual storytellers in the world, and adapting these wonderful books by Charlie Huston for Austin to star was too exciting an opportunity to not be a part of,” said Sanford Panitch, president of Sony Pictures’ Motion Picture Group.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Aronofsky is repped by CAA,&nbsp;Narrative and&nbsp;Goodman Genow.
