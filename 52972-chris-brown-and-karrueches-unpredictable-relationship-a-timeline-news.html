"My interview w Access Hollywood was not entirely about you.. they asked a question and as a mature adult I answered. I'm not gonna shy away from something that I lived through. I'm talking about my life and experiences. I'm not speaking on you or bashing you (like I easily could). Don't be mad at me because our relationship is over due to your lack of loyalty. You know what's weak?? You forcing yourself into my car.. my broken window.. blowing up my phone.. trying to shower me w gifts..

Which is understandable, but it sucks, because I’m not a weak person,” she says. "I used to date him, and now as I am growing into myself and maturing and getting my career together, I am starting to have my own name without having to be associated ... I feel like I shouldn't have to explain myself to anybody because this is my life and I can do whatever I want.
