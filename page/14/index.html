In the very first episode following a nearly 3-year-long Euphoria drought, Levinson plants the seeds of romance between two characters we've yet to see cross paths: Fez (Angus Cloud), the local drug dealer, and Lexi Howard (Maude Apatow), the nerdy younger sister of Euphoria high's very own Barbie girl, Cassie (Sydney Sweeney). The show opens with Fezco's backstory (he's a sweet kid abused by his father before he's taken in by his well-meaning but ultimately irresponsible drug-dealing grandma), then pivots to the present day: A New Year's Eve party where Lexi and Fez serendipitously find themselves sitting next to one another on the couch.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Instagram Gallery: An Introduction To Polo G</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>
