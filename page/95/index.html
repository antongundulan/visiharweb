Sittin' there sittin' there sittin' there all alone
I been feeling kinda strange lately
I don't know what's going on baby
Ever since I came back from out of town
Something's telling me some bullshit is going down

Boy is there someone else you're seeking
Is it someone else
My vital's telling me you're creeping
Finding numbers in your jeans
You're talking in your sleep

No place to lay his head
No one to call a friendHe always blamed himself
And counted his mistakes
He had no hope for life
He thought it‚Äôs all too late
I told him let me tell you about this man I know

Richie Keen‚Äôs Fist Fight, which isn‚Äôt a remake of either film, makes a considerably blander promise to viewers: There‚Äôs going to be a fight.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>90 Day Fiance Couple Brandan and Mary Welcome First Child!</h2><time>Aug 15, 2024</time>
