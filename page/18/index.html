Well he was Thailand based
She was an air force wife
He used to fly weekends
It was the easy life
But then it turned around and he began to change
She didn't wonder then
She didn't think it strange
But then he got a call
He had to leave that night
He couldn't say too much
But it would be alright
He didn't need to pack
They'd meet the next night</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lil Wayne Tap Out lyrics</h2><time>Aug 28, 2024</time>

If you hating, you just need some pussy
She fucked up when she gave me some pussy

And she don’t like them pretty niggas, siddity niggas
She ride this dick- her titties jiggle, that’s my pillows
That's because I sleep in that ho, hit it when I wake up</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Miona and Jibri had relationship issues 90 Days before she got to the US Sun 17 April 2022 23:4</h2><time>Aug 28, 2024</time>
