<a href=../../solitaire-html.html></a>
There was a man
A lonely man
Who lost his love
Through his indifferenceA heart that cared
That went unshared
Until it died
Within his silence
And solitare's the only game in town
And every road that takes him
Takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again
And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love
It always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Alec Baldwin children: What do we know about the actors kids?</h2><time>Aug 19, 2024</time>
