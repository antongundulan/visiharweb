An artist has pledged to paint portraits of every single resident in Britain’s smallest city, having already spent 10 years on the project.
Grahame Hurd-Wood has completed just under 900 portraits of people in St Davids, Haverfordwest, Wales, and hopes to eventually paint around 1,600 portraits, saying he will aim to do so even if the project takes him another 20 years.

[This story contains minor spoilers for Disney and Pixar’s Incredibles 2.]
In Incredibles 2, the Parr family finally learns what the audience (and the family’s poor, well-intention babysitter) have known for the last 14 years: baby Jack-Jack, previously thought to be a normal, non-powered human, is in fact extremely powered. He’s so powered, in fact, he’s got basically every superpower you could imagine, and they’re all manifesting out of control. From bursting into flames to transforming into a baby Hulk-like demon, Jack-Jack is easily the most powerful person in the family — maybe even in the entire Incredibles universe, all before he’s out of diapers.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Benjamin Pajak Fan Casting</h2><time>Aug 5, 2024</time>
