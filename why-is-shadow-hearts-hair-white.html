In your camp Nightsong reveals what she knows about Shadowheart.</li><li>Long rest. …</li><li>Continue the story.</li><h2>What color is Shadowhearts hair?</h2><p>Baldur’s Gate 3</p><p>Yeah, all of the sudden Shadowheart hair color changed from black to ashen white.</p><h2>What is Shadow Hearts real name?</h2><p>The story of Shadow Hearts is set in 1913 and follows Yuri Hyuga, a human with the ability to capture and transform into monsters, as he protects Alice Elliot from the machinations of an evil magician.</p><h2>What happens if you free Shadow Hearts parents?</h2><p>What Happens If You Betray Shar And Save Shadowheart’s Parents? You can choose to save Shadowheart’s parents in either path (Shar or Selune). Both paths will lead to the same outcome with this choice: Shadowheart’s parents will be freed and brought to camp to join you for the remainder of the game.</p><h2>All Companion Reactions to Shadowheart’s White Hair</h2><h2>How old is Shadowheart?</h2><p>Baldur’s Gate 3 players surprised to discover that, due to elf shenanigans, Shadowheart is actually over 40 years old. Baldur’s Gate 3 – Shadowheart is HOW old?!</p><h2>What happens if Shadowheart becomes a Dark Justiciar?</h2><p>If you let Shadowheart kill the Nightsong, she will go full Dark Justiciar of Shar mode. Be prepared for her to be dark, brooding, and rather evil for the rest of the game. However, she will gain some powerful gear in return, the most impressive of which is the legendary weapon Shar’s Spear of Evening.</p><h2>Is Shadowheart’s hair supposed to be white?</h2><p>It doesn’t matter what choice you make: She changes her hairstyle regardless of outcome. The only thing that changes is *how* her hair changes. If you spare NIghtsong, she dyes her hair white and the bangs change. If you kill Nightsong, it stays black and the bangs change.</p><h2>Is it possible to free Shadowheart?</h2><p>Use your Illithid power to “Will the pod to open,” which will set Shadowheart free. Once Shadowheart is free, she’ll join your party whether you want her or not – at least for now. With the upcoming boss battle, she’ll be a notable asset to you.</p><h2>Can you romance Shadowheart if she kills Nightsong?</h2><p>You can convince her to leave a little room for you, which will get you a minimised relationship, but you can’t fully romance Shadowheart unless you save the Nightsong. Doing this will cause her to become a Cleric of Selune, freeing her heart to find true love with your character.</p><h2>Should I let Shadowheart do the trials?</h2><p>When she asks, let Shadowheart do it in your stead to earn extra favor with her, if you’d like. This will open the gates and you’ll be able to enter the main trial area. This is a combat trial, so be prepared. It’s also a trial that’s all about using Shadowheart for her Radiant spells.</p><h2>How do you trigger Shadowheart romance?</h2><p>During the early access period, the Baldur’s Gate 3 Shadowheart romance simply meant being in good standing with her, and saving the Tiefling refugees. This leads to a party back in your camp, where you and Shadowheart can have a drink. This also lets you kiss her, which advances the romance further.</p><h2>Can you lift the shadow curse?</h2><p>Finally, after reuniting the two halves of Thaniel, he’ll come to your camp and tell you that in order to fully lift the Shadow Curse, you’ll need to defeat Ketheric Thorm. Unfortunately, as the game is fond of reminding us, Ketheric is immortal and cannot be killed by normal means.</p><h2>Does Shadowheart get her memories back?</h2><p>If you collect the noblestalk from the bibberbang field while rescuing the mushroom picker, you can convince Shadowheart to eat it. This will partially restore her memories, and she’ll remember a childhood friend, Rennald, and suggest searching for him in Baldur’s Gate.</p><h2>Can you stop Shadowheart from killing Nightsong?</h2><p>The Nightsong quest is part of Shadowheart’s quest chain in Act 2, and players can either choose to kill her or get Shadowheart to keep her alive.</p><h2>Is Shadowheart brainwashed?</h2><p>While Shadowheart is not a Cleric of Selûne, she can convert to her faith after Shar abandons her for sparing the Nightsong. On the other hand, she was in fact brainwashed by the Sharrans, even before she lost her memory in the mission to retrieve the artifact.</p><h2>Why did Shadowheart leave me?</h2><p>First things first, if you let Balthazar take the Nightsong back to Thorm, Shadowheart will abandon your group. The Nightsong needs to die for Lady Shar, so to let some necromancer run away with her is a massive betrayal.</p><h2>Why do Shadowheart and Lae Zel hate each other?</h2><p>Both had to fight and kill their peers in order to win any amount of conditional love and praise. In short, both are survivors of abuse and have been molded by abusive relationships. And when they’re around each other, what they hate most about themselves is reflected in the other.</p><h2>Can Shadowheart turn to Selune?</h2><p>Save Nightsong – This turns the Spear of Night into Selune’s Spear of Evening and Shadowheart converts to worshipping Selune, leaving her available to romance and changing her appearance.</p><h2>Who is Shadowheart’s father?</h2><p>As a girl, Jenevelle Hallowleaf lived with her parents, Arnell Hallowleaf, an elf werewolf, and Emmeline, a human, both devoted followers of Selûne. As a child of Selûnites, Jenevelle underwent a rite of passage involving finding her way home alone from the woods.</p><h2>Is Shadowheart her real name?</h2><p>In the inner sanctum, you’ll see her parents chained via magical means. As you approach, a cutscene will trigger. You learn Shadowheart’s real name: Jenevelle Santos Hallowleaf.</p><h2>How to seduce Shadowheart?</h2><p>Players that pursue the Selune route should speak with Shadowheart after exiting the Mausoleum and indicate that she is “not alone.” These fans should then wait for Shadowheart to “change her look,” tell her that they “love it” during a conversion in camp, indicate that they want to talk about their relationship, and …</p><h2>How do you befriend Shadowheart?</h2><p>Showing mercy after battle and using Persuasion or Deception rather than force boosts Shadowheart’s approval in multiple scenarios (though trying to sweet-talk an enemy of the party might not always be the way to go). You can also level up your relationship by showing kindness to animals.</p><h2>Can you romance Shadowheart without her in your party?</h2><p>Unlike other companions, Shadowheart’s scene that progresses her romance is a scene that you’ll be required to get during the main quest so long as you have Shadowheart in your party.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWWlr5ww8eyZKKrXai1orDOsGShnZGnwbR5x5qgq2Wnnba1sY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dave-lawson.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Dave Lawson?
