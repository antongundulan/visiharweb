In a strange turn of events, however, there actually is no suspect. White revealed today that <a href=# rel>he made the whole thing up</a>, laughing at those who believed his fabricated claims.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Charleston White Accuses Sexyy Red Of Having An STD</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-charleston-white-laughs-at-those-who-believed-him>Charleston White Laughs At Those Who Believed Him</h2></span><p>"You internet n***as believe anything," he began, chuckling. <a href=# rel>"The truth is not the truth anymore because of the internet."</a> White continued, describing how internet users believed his story without much real evidence. "No blood on my shirt, I got my chain on, and no video footage," he said. "All y'all got is evidence of me saying what I'm saying." He then laughed out loud again, mocking whoever he was able to fool. "The truth is what you can make motherf*ckers believe," he claimed.</p><p>Many commenters are now confused about why White was in an ambulance, and curious if he was actually injured and only lied about how it occurred. He appears to be unharmed and in good spirits, however. Others say that they knew his story was a lie the entire time, claiming that <a href=# rel>it sounded far-fetched</a> from the very beginning. It's unclear why White decided to trick his followers, but it seems like it was just a strange attempt to teach internet users not to believe everything they hear.
