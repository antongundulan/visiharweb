He was 83.</p><p>In a career that spanned more than 50 years, Hookstratten was a powerful and iconic force in show business, with clients that included <strong>Elvis Presley</strong>, <strong>Dan Rowan & Dick Martin</strong>, <strong>Joey Bishop</strong> and <strong>Johnny Carson</strong>&nbsp;(he <a href=#>replaced Henry Bushkin at Carson Productions</a>);&nbsp;news personalities <strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong>, <strong>Tom Brokaw</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Tom Snyder </strong>and<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Jessica&nbsp;Savitch</strong>; and <strong>Vin Scully</strong>, <strong>Dick Enberg</strong>, <strong>Phyllis George</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Merlin Olsen,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Harry Kalas</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Dick Stockton</strong>, <strong>Pat Haden</strong>,<strong> Marcus Allen&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Don Meredith </strong>from the world of sports.</p><p>Widely known as “The Hook,”&nbsp;the attorney had a well-deserved reputation for getting his star clients innovative, lucrative and unprecedented deals.&nbsp;</p><p>Amid an intense three-network bidding war, Hookstratten engineered Gumbel’s move from NBC in 1997 to CBS with a contract that paid the longtime Today show host nearly $5 million a year. Earlier, he got&nbsp;L.A. anchorman <strong>Paul Moyer</strong> a whopping $1.4 million a year to shift from KABC Channel 7 to KNBC Channel 4 in 1992.</p><p>He was particularly powerful on the local&nbsp;L.A. news scene, also representing <strong>Pat O’Brien</strong>, <strong>Hal&nbsp;Fishman</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Steve Rambo</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;Ann Martin</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Colleen Williams</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Jim Hill</strong> in addition to Moyer.</p><p>Said Brokaw: “The Hook was a one-man force in the agency business, the last of the great and effective lone operators who knew everyone on both sides of the table.&nbsp;</p><p>“I remember the first time I hired him. I was up for a big job at NBC, and when I told the executive in charge Ed would represent me, he clutched his heart and said, ‘Oh, God — the Hook!’ I knew then I was in good hands.”</p><p>“When you’re negotiating with Hook, you’re playing at a big poker table,” then-NBC News president&nbsp;<strong>Andrew Lack</strong>&nbsp;told the Los Angeles Times in a 1994 profile of the industry’s top TV agents. “Does he occasionally bluff? Sure. But he takes care of his clients, and I like him enormously.”</p><p>“He can be a real (expletive) when he wants to,” added Moyer in the Times piece. “And that’s what I pay him for. Underneath he’s a sweet man and not that complicated. But he drives the networks crazy.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>VIDEO: ‘Today’ Reunion: Jane Pauley and Bryant Gumbel Look Back, Cook on Monday’s Show</a></strong></p><p>“Ed Hookstratten was a brilliant lawyer, my representative and one of my dearest friends in all the world,” added Scully. “He introduced me to my wife <strong>Sandi</strong>, was our best man at the wedding and was there for me during my darkest hours. My heart goes out to his family with deepest sympathy.”</p><p>Hookstratten, who once described his business as “a boutique as opposed to a factory,”&nbsp;also represented high-profile pro basketball and football coaches such as&nbsp;<strong>Pat Riley</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;George Allen</strong>, <strong>John Robinson</strong>, <strong>Chuck Knox</strong> and <strong>Jack Pardee&nbsp;</strong>and served for several years as general counsel for the NFL’s Los Angeles Rams.</p><p>His name surfaces in former Paramount studio head&nbsp;<strong>Robert Evans</strong>’ 1994 book&nbsp;The Kid Stays in the Picture&nbsp;and in&nbsp;Those Guys Have All the Fun, the ESPN origin story written by&nbsp;<strong>James Andrew Miller</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Tom&nbsp;Shales&nbsp;</strong>that was published in 2011.</p><p>Hookstratten&nbsp;also served as the namesake of the “Lt. Bob&nbsp;Hookstratten”&nbsp;character (<strong>Fred Willard</strong>, who welcomes the band to Lindbergh Air Force Base in Seattle to play at its monthly “at-ease weekend”)&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>Rob&nbsp;</strong><strong>Reiner</strong>’s&nbsp;rock&nbsp;mockumentary&nbsp;This Is Spinal Tap&nbsp;(1984).</p><p>Born in 1930 in Whittier, Calif., Hookstratten attended USC on a baseball scholarship and earned his law degree from Southwestern School of Law.</p><p>Survivors include his wife, <strong>Aimee</strong>; his former wife, Please Don’t Eat the Daisies TV star&nbsp;<strong>Pat Crowley Friendly</strong>; his brother&nbsp;<strong>Jim</strong>; his son <strong>Jon</strong>; his daughters <strong>Ann</strong>, <strong>Eve</strong> and <strong>Mae</strong>; and his grandchildren <strong>Eddie</strong>, <strong>Erin</strong>, <strong>Katie</strong>, <strong>Will</strong> and <strong>Clare</strong>.</p><p>“My father was a larger-than-life personality in a town that specializes in them. He was obsessed with taking care of his clients, who became a part of his family,” said Jon.</p><p>Memorial service arrangements are forthcoming. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made in his memory to USC Athletics – Baseball, c/o Jill Dennis, 3501 Watt Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089-0602.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Twitter: @mikebarnes4</a></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKawjKGmqKOjqb%2BiwNOepWaekaKypXnSqaarrKNisq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwIxvbmxuY2V8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ebraheem-al-samadi-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Ebraheem Al Samadi Net Worth 2024</span></a>
