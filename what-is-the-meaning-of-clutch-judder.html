Either add frames so that it changes every frame, or even out the repeated frames so they are consistent, and posterise the timing of the background so that the frame rate matches.<h2>What does motion blur do?</h2>Motion blur is the blur seen in moving objects in a photograph or a single frame of film or video. It happens because objects move during the time it takes to expose the photo or the frame, and the movement gets recorded as a blur.<h2>Why does my car jerk when I release the clutch?</h2>A synchronization ring is a clutch / gear equipment which during the gear shift gets the cone of the speed gear either to speed it up or slow it down. In case that the car jerking while releasing clutch problem isn't settled, then synchronization rings can break and the car can start jerking heavily.<h2>Why is my manual car shaking?</h2>Driving on tires that are over-inflated or under-inflated can cause the car to shake. If this doesn't solve the problem, you may need to take the car in to get the tires balanced, rotated, or replaced. Improper wheel alignment, or a worn suspension, can cause your tires to wear unevenly and lead to shaking.<h2>Why does my manual car shake when I shift?</h2>Most of the time this car shaking is caused by the transmission, though it can sometimes be caused by a bent exhaust or one that's different to the original.
