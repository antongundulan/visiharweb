Also, Knuckles purposely shatters the Master Emerald to save it from Dr.<h2>Is Knuckles Sonic's friend or enemy?</h2>However, Knuckles wasn't always a hero, as his first appearance made him a villain. Sonic the Hedgehog 3 introduced Knuckles to the franchise's canon by making him an opponent for Sonic.

In Sonic Adventure 2, he saved Rouge when she lost her footing and was (presumably) going to fall into lava.</p><h2>Do Knuckles like rouge?</h2>Knuckles even calls Rouge a "thief" and shows an amount of annoyance yet some attraction and careness for her like Batman with Catwoman. Speaking of Catwoman, Rouge also flirts a lot with Knuckles like Catwoman flirts with Batman.<h2>Why did Eggman save Sonic?</h2>Eggman just let Sonic fall in the lava he would of 100% defeated him. Instead his hubris got him to rescue Sonic for the sake of the boss battle.<h2>Was Knuckles a good guy?</h2>Yes, Knuckles is a bad guy in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, following the video game source material closely. Knuckles was first introduced in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 by Sega, where the character began as Sonic's opponent after Dr. Robotnik manipulated him.<h2>Is Tikal related to Knuckles?</h2>They are not related.<h2>How did Sonic meet Tails?</h2>However in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, its explained that Tails met Sonic on West Island when he wanted to show Sonic his plane called the Tornado.<h2>Who is Sonic's best friend?</h2>Miles Prower, better known by his nickname Tails, is a two-tailed fox who is Sonic's best friend and sidekick.<h2>Will Knuckles be in Sonic 2?</h2>The recently released video game sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is currently lighting up the box office, and now, director Jeff Fowler has teased what's next for both the titular hedgehog and Idris Elba's Knuckles. Introduced in the sequel, it has since been confirmed that Knuckles will star in his own spinoff series.<h2>How many times was Knuckles tricked by Eggman?</h2>Knuckles has been tricked 6 times in all of the TV shows he stars in.<h2>Why did Eggman become evil?</h2>Kintobor was transformed into Robotnik by a laboratory accident involving the Chaos Emeralds and a rotten egg, becoming his own evil opposite, who frequently used egg-related puns in his dialogue.<h2>Why is Sonic black?</h2>These comments are prompted by the negative energy Sonic can feel from the fake emeralds. It is this dark chaos energy that incredibly intensifies Sonic's rage at seeing an unconscious Chris and a terrified Cosmo trapped, that causes him to turn into Dark Sonic in his mid-transfomation form.<h2>Who is Rouge boyfriend in Sonic?</h2>Topaz. Topaz is Rouge's partner.<h2>Who is Tails in love with?</h2>In Sonic X, Tails falls in love with Cosmo – a talking plant-alien-girl (a Seedrian, specifically) although the love doesn't seem to be love in a traditional sense – the two act as if in a very close friendship, though it's obvious they harbour feelings for each other.<h2>Do Knuckles love grapes?</h2>True Sonic fans however are well aware of Knuckles' longtime love of grapes. Despite it never being relevant to the games, it has frequently been said in his profiles that his favourite food is grapes, a far cry from his rival's penchant for eating fast food.<h2>How old is Knuckles Sonic 2?</h2>He was described as being 15 years old when he made his debut, but since Sonic Adventure, he is stated to be 16.
