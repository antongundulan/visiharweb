He then added, "We had someone ... in our house, evidently, and they stabbed somebody." While the condition of Robert Wone's body was unsettling for the first responders, so was the behavior of Zaborsky, Joseph Price, and Dylan Ward. All three men looked freshly showered and wore white bathrobes. They were eerily quiet; Price did most of the talking to the paramedics and police.</p><p>At the same time, the housemates were very cooperative and willingly went through hours of questioning by law enforcement, submitting their fingerprints and DNA samples within days. The trio stuck with their story as well, that an intruder had committed the horrid murder. Price told detectives, "I know it sounds crazy. In fact, if you told me this and I wasn't in this place all night, I would say, 'No way, it cannot happen — that's crazy.' But damned if it didn't," as reported by the Washingtonian.</p><p>However, investigators were still highly skeptical because that meant the killer had to climb a 7-foot wall, walk up a flight of stairs, pass by an occupied bedroom, and then commit the murder completely undetected. The suspect would have then left without taking any of the electronics, cash, or other valuables in the house. Then there was the fact that police found undisturbed dust and cobwebs where the suspect supposedly moved through the property.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kWpua2lkZL%2BwrsSrq2avn6OybrTIrGSmsaOpsrO1zq6qZpmemXqpu9GroJ%2Bhk2LCr7%2FOpa2enF2iwrOwxKtknrCgoa6qusSdZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./guylaine-tanguay-net-worth-income-html.html><span>←</span><span>Guylaine Tanguay Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
