The Wales family of five has long loved sport, and royal biographer Christopher Andersen said, per <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://okmagazine.com/p/prince-william-kate-middleton-attending-sporting-events-distraction-health-woes/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>OK</u></a>, that “Now more than ever, sports provide a much-needed distraction from the pressures of royal life—and from the harsh reality of the health challenges being faced by Kate and King Charles,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cgcrG2FWD9pSYXNzdVgYhR-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AbzBocqC5rEURyFJ2riYBQ-1920-80.jpg><p>In addition to Kate revealing her cancer diagnosis in March, the King, too, revealed his own diagnosis the month prior.</p><p>“To say sports play a huge part in the lives of the royals is a massive understatement,” Andersen added. “It’s in their blood.” He quipped “What sport don’t they participate in? Maybe cage fighting—although I wouldn’t put that past <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-harry/>Prince Harry</a>—but that’s about it.”</p><p>Andersen noted that men of the royal family tend to be drawn to activities like polo and skiing, while the late <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/diana/>Princess Diana</a> was an avid swimmer. Kate, for her part, has always been described as “sporty,” which is “one of the main things that attracted William to her,” he said. “It also made her an easy fit for the hyper-athletic royal family.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7skTojQauf53FLjwEhYbbV-1920-80.jpg><p>Of the Princess of Wales, Andersen said that “Kate may be the sportiest royal of all. In high school, she was a star player in hockey and tennis. She’s also an accomplished skier, runner, and sailor—Kate has always seemed game for anything. What sets her apart from the rest of the royal pack is that she always does it with a smile.”</p><p>William and Kate are both “hugely competitive,” photographer Helena Chard said, and that “keeps their spark alive—sports and laughter go hand in hand,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eW4vjQnw3F88HdHYbCZWSA-1920-80.jpg><p>This competitive spirit has been passed down to George, Charlotte, and Louis, and “It’s very sweet to see them competing in sports, especially rowing,” she said. “They are full of energy, smiles, and love. Their fun, animated side comes out to play.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
