He shared confidential information about Gilead in exchange for his freedom. He would be tried in Geneva and would ultimately leave unscathed. So June takes the consequences into her own hands. She gets Commander Lawrence to set up a trade: Return Fred to Gilead to stand trial in exchange for the 22 women held hostage for being part of the resistance. On the other side of the Canadian border, Nick drives Fred into No Man's Land, where he is met with June and a group of women who brutalize him to death.</p><img alt="handmaid's tale" title="handmaid's tale" width=3000 height=1996 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tht-ep410-d7-sg-0181rt-1623863278.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Hulu</span><p>Joseph Fiennes as Fred Waterford</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At first, the actual state of Fred's fate is unclear. We see June emerge from the forest bloodied and bruised, but not her victim. One of Fred's severed fingers (and wedding ring) is sent to his wife, Serena, in the mail. It's not until the final moments of the episode that we see the confirmation, plain and simple: Fred is dead, his headless body hanging on the wall where miscreant handmaids were hung. Below his feet read the words, "Nolite te bastardes carborundorum," in bloodred.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The fake Latin phrase is not new for Handmaid's Tale viewers; it appears in Margaret Atwood's book and earlier in the series, and was even the title for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hulu.com/watch/9fe5be7b-485b-4be7-977c-b17b76cd4905 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Season 1, Episode 4" data-vars-ga-product-id=225db217-92c6-44cb-bd5b-e887e95c9a12 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.hulu.com/watch/9fe5be7b-485b-4be7-977c-b17b76cd4905 data-product-url=https://www.hulu.com/watch/9fe5be7b-485b-4be7-977c-b17b76cd4905 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fwatch%2F9fe5be7b-485b-4be7-977c-b17b76cd4905" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=lu data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=94fa7bf8-84bd-43a8-9d5e-ed3e162e8c76 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=lu class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Season 1, Episode 4</a>. In the context of the story, the idiom roughly translates to, "Don't let the bastards grind you down," but it's composed of made-up words.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'll tell you the weird thing about it: It was a joke in our Latin classes," Atwood <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/4734904/margaret-atwood-elisabeth-moss-handmaids-tale/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">said</a> of the slogan, which evolved into a popular rallying cry and tattoo design. "So this thing from my childhood is permanently on people's bodies."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Speaking to Michael Fontaine, a classics professor from Cornell University, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/handmaids-tale-nolite-te-bastardes-carborundorum-origin-margaret-atwood data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Vanity Fair</a> previously broke down the saying.</p>“Nolite” means “don’t” (plural) in Latin, Fontaine wrote in an e-mail, while “te” means “you.” “Bastardes,” however, is a made-up word with a Latin suffix, and “carborundorum” is not Latin either.<p>Per Fontaine, “carborundorum” is an English word that originated around 120 years ago; the Oxford English Dictionary, indicates that carborundorum was an industrial product used as an abrasive.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite the term's fabricated origin, there's no denying the power behind it, especially on-screen with Fred getting what he deserves.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's fantastic to see Fred Waterford on the wall," Elisabeth Moss told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/handmaids-tale-season-finale-elisabeth-moss-june-fred-1234968048/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Hollywood Reporter</a> of the Season 4 finale.
