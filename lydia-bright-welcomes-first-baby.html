The 29-year-old former TOWIE star confirmed her happy news exclusively to <strong>HELLO!</strong>, saying: "My darling girl has arrived. I am so overwhelmed with love, she is absolutely perfect." Lydia also shared the very first photo of her beautiful newborn, who arrived on Friday, showing her holding her tiny hand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dd04a046455f-lydia-bright-baby-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ehSzcbxxZzZ data-wc=10><strong>Lydia Bright has welcomed her first child, a baby girl</strong></p><p id=e8Bx1-CPtL4 data-wc=62>Lydia has long dreamt of being a mother, and in August last year she <a class=hm-link href=#>shared her pregnancy joy</a> in an exclusive interview with <strong>HELLO!</strong> magazine. "I know that this baby will be the best thing that's ever happened to me," said the star. She also admitted she was dreading giving birth but added: "At the end of it obviously I'm going to have a beautiful baby."</p><p id=ekWp7d22kRtf data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Lydia Bright exclusively reveals gender of her baby – watch video</a></strong></p><p id=e9dB8TBUjSDD data-wc=71>The following month, Lydia discovered she was <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>expecting a little girl</a> </strong>at a gender reveal party. "I wasn't bothered either way, girl or boy, but I do think that now I know it's a girl it's that little bit more special," she shared. "She'll be my best friend. Me and Mum are really close and I love our relationship – I'm hoping that me and my daughter have something just as special, just as strong."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=eUzRra1sw1Kv data-wc=119>Lydia recently celebrated the impending arrival of her baby with a weekend-long baby shower in Wales. The star headed to the luxurious Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, where she was joined by her sisters Georgia and Roma and mum Debbie, as well as Denise van Outen and TOWIE stars Amber Dowding and <a class=hm-link href=#>Lucy Mecklenburgh</a>, who is due to welcome her first child, a baby boy, any day now. Lydia posted a snap of her walking towards the modern wood-panelled lodge wearing a white gown emblazoned with the words 'mummy-to-be'. "Every girls dream. 15 of my nearest and dearest away to celebrate my birthday and baby shower @thecelticmanor. Feeling like the luckiest girl in the world," she wrote alongside the picture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e8111a350a22-lydia-bright-pregnant-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eHjtpynkyZ-f data-wc=7><strong>Lydia welcomed her little girl on Friday</strong></p><p id=eEJCB1U6yr4s data-wc=73>There were also plenty of pink balloons and inflatable silver letters spelling out the name Dinky – which was how Lydia's late grandmother was known. "My little bump got her nickname from the original Dinky Bright,"&nbsp;she told <strong>HELLO!</strong>&nbsp;"My paternal grandmother who sadly passed away at the age of 21. I'm still struggling with a name but I have a feeling whatever it will be, everyone will know her as little Dinky."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
