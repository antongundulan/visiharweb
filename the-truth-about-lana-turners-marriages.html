She married restaurateur Steve Crane in 1942, but she found out that it wasn't official, since Crane's divorce from his first wife wasn't finalized (per <a href=#>Mental Floss</a>). While that first attempt at marriage was annulled, the pair tried again in 1943. Turner was pregnant at the time with her only child, daughter Cheryl, but having a baby together did nothing for their relationship. Turner filed for divorce in 1944.</p><p dir=ltr>While her romantic life may have been failing, Turner enjoyed success with such films as "Slightly Dangerous" (1943) and "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (1946) around this time. It wasn't long, though, before Turner was willing to try luck again with love. This time around, she fell for a fellow film star, Tyrone Power, in 1946 (per <a href=#>Closer Weekly</a>). Turner described him as "the most gentlemanly, enchanting man I had ever known," but he, like Crane, was still married when they got together. She became pregnant by Power, but she chose to have an abortion. Having a baby out of wedlock would have sunk both of their careers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDlm1nbWpfqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZqOappFiwba%2BzZ6prGWdlr%2BztcCgnKxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ferrari-movie-true-story.html><span>←</span><span>The True Story Behind Adam Driver's Enzo Ferrari Movie</span></a>
