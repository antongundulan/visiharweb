 Feb 14th 2011 !⃝ I read an article on the internet about how this song was about a group of teens no older than 17 and were out driving and got in a wreck with a flatbed logging truck. Originally the song was released by Wayne Cochran & the C.C. Riders later covered by Frank J. Wilson and the Cavaliers only to be covered yet again by Pearl Jam."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

This part was copied and pasted from the site I read the article and respects to them.<br>~~~~~~~~"Sixteen-year-old Jeanette Clark was out on a date in Barnesville, Georgia on<br>December 22, 1962, the Saturday before Christmas. She was with a group<br>of friends in a 1954 Chevrolet. J. L. Hancock, also sixteen, was driving the<br>car in heavy traffic and while traveling on Highway 341, collided with a trailer<br>truck. Clark, Hancock, and another teenager were killed, and two other teens<br>in the car were seriously injured. Cochran dedicated the song to Clark.~~~~~~~~</p><p>If you wanna see the site the link is below</p><p>http://www.listzblog.com/top_ten_teenage_tragedy_songs_music_history_list.html</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZqmdkae5brbApmalmaOpeqy10qw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-96-room-mercure-auckland-hotel-planned-by-paris-hq-business.html><span>←</span><span>New 96-room Mercure Auckland hotel planned by Paris-HQ business</span></a>
