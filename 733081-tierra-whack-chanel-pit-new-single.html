Well, Tierra presents that in full.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, with her not being a mainstream name, many listeners who are complaining about this very issue might not ever get to unearth her talents. If people are going to put all this effort into talking about it, they should put the same amount of energy into finding new voices. Another factor hurting Whack is the marketing of sexuality in rap. Almost of the popular female rappers now are promoting their looks rather than their talent. While they are certainly inclined to form their careers however they want, in the long run, it hurts the genre.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-chanel-pit-from-tierra-whack>Listen To "Chanel Pit" From Tierra Whack</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, that is not the reason for this article. Whack has a new single out, her second of the year. This follows up on her "Millions" release from late March. According to Fader, she will finally be <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">getting out</a> her second full-length tape. It has been five years since her debut and this new LP is expected to be out at the beginning of 2024. Whack's quirkiness shines all throughout "Chanel Pit," and you should give it a whirl if you have not already.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your initial thoughts on this brand-new single from Tierra Whack, "Chanel Pit?"
