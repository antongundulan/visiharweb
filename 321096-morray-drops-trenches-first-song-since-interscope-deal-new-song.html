"Breakfast in the morning, yeah it's finger-lickin' good / bunch of laugh outside the window kids playing in the hood," he raps, with passionate intensity to his delivery. "Get dressed step out, know today is gonna be good / but I'm still on high alert cause n**as still from the hood."&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Speaking with Zane Lowe, Morray explained why he desired to paint a more nuanced portrait of life in the ghetto. "I really want people to understand that the ghetto ain't all bad," he explains. "We're not all in there sad, we're not all running amok and led astray. Some of us are really in there living our lives. We still go outside, we still hanging out, play basketball, chill with our homies, sit on the porch, play basketball, kids hula hooping. It's regular out there. It's not all just bad. We know how to celebrate the good. We can still celebrate our smiles too."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check out "Trenches" now, and look for Morray's upcoming&nbsp;Street Sermon&nbsp;mixtape to arrive in full on April 28th.&nbsp;</p><p><h3><span><strong>QUOTABLE LYRICS</strong></span></h3></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Everybody see the ghetto as being a bad place<br>Where people run amok where n***as stuck in a sad state<br>They don't see the good times that outweigh the bad days<br>In the hood we still smile to lighten up them dark caves</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Feature Editor&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Mitch Findlay is a writer and hip-hop journalist based in Montreal.
