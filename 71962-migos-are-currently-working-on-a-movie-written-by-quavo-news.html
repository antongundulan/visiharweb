Offset immediately answered "movies," prompting Zane to inquire exactly what he meant by that, questioning whether the rapper meant "producing, acting, writing, script writing [or] directing?"&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Producing, all of it, as one," says Offset.&nbsp;&nbsp;“My boy Quavo writing the scripts. He been in that kitchen trying to whip up.” Quavo goes on to elaborate on his motivation to explore a new and exciting creative outlet:</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I always been watching movies, and watching like, my favorite musician do movies...They really used to do that a lot in the nineties.&nbsp;I’m a ’90s baby and all my favorite movies got all my&nbsp;dope artists in ’em...Juice,&nbsp;Menace II Society, All the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Snoop Dogg</a> movies, Master P movies,&nbsp;I Got the Hook-Up,&nbsp;Baller Blockin’&nbsp;the&nbsp;Big Tymers movie...Even <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ice Cube</a>, Cube killed it! That’s what we’re doing right now we’re looking into the script.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">With&nbsp;Culture 2&nbsp;rumored to be dropping this autumn (with some unconfirmed whispers of an October release), it's cool to see that the Migos men are keeping busy with some ambitious creative goals. There's no word on whether or not the film would be a biopic or a work of fiction, but either way, it should be dope if and when it actually drops. Imagine Quavo fighting goons alongside Jet Li, like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DMX</a> did back in the early two thousands. The possibilities are endless.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For those eager for news on Quavo and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Travis Scott</a>'s upcoming collaborative project, Quavo hinted that they were in the final stages. In fact, all that seems to remain is finalizing the tracklist. Stay tuned for that, as well as&nbsp;Culture 2,&nbsp;no doubt coming soon.</p><p>Migos Are Currently Working On A Movie Written By Quavo</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Feature Editor&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Mitch Findlay is a writer and hip-hop journalist based in Montreal.
