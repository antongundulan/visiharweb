If a driver or delivery person has an issue with signing into or going online to their account, they should contact Support rather than creating a duplicate account.<h2>Can I do Uber If the car is not under my name?</h2>Uber accepts both official and temporary registration documents. The vehicle does not need to be registered in your name to qualify.<h2>Can I drive Uber with my wife?</h2>As outlined in our Community Guidelines, no one other than the requesting rider and the rider's guests are permitted in the vehicle. This means that friends and family of drivers may not ride in their vehicle during a trip. See our Community Guidelines for more details.<h2>Can I use a different phone for Uber driver?</h2>Drivers must use iPhones with iOS 11.0 or higher, and Android version 5 or higher. Phones that are used by Drivers must also have a minimum of 2GB of data available every month.

Lyft and Uber drivers earn approximately the same average per month, but the tips and earnings per trip are higher for Lyft.<h2>Is it worth being a Uber driver?</h2>Overall, driving for Uber is still a worthwhile side hustle for many people. You're not going to get rich driving people around in your spare time, but it's a flexible way to make extra money.<h2>Can Uber pick up my teenager?</h2>Teens can't use Uber without explicit permission from a parent. Teen accounts are only available as part of a Family Profile and require both the parent and the teen to opt-in. Parents receive regular notifications throughout every trip their teen takes.<h2>Can I drive uber eats with my child?</h2>Taking the time to become an UberEATS driver is one of them.
