It's his home city, after all, and the city where he makes his grand living. In 2010, Osteen and his wife, Victoria, bought a mansion in the River Oaks suburb of the city. They live there with their two children: daughter Alexandra and son Jonathan. For the last decade, the Osteen family has been living there. The house is located in the wealthy subdivision of Tall Timbers.</p><p dir=ltr>Their home is 17,000 square feet and sits on close to two acres of land (via <a href=#>CultureMap Houston</a>). The Osteen house, which boasts five wood fireplaces, has a total of six bedrooms, six bathrooms, three elevators, a guest house, a large outdoor pool in the backyard, and a pool house. Quite a lot of space for a family of four. Nevertheless, it didn't come cheap. Osteen paid $10.5 million for it in 2010, noted&nbsp;<a href=#>Velvet Ropes</a>. It is very likely the value of the home is higher now. <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that Joel Osteen's house may be worth between $14 to $16 million today.</p><p dir=ltr>The couple reportedly also has a&nbsp;5,600-square-foot home in the Tanglewood area of Houston. That house is worth&nbsp;about $2.9 million, according to <a href=#>Distractify</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAmGpramlfnbKzsdJmn6ivXaLCpLSMo6aepF2kwLWxxKeqZqWRo8Cqu81mqZ6ZnKHGbq%2FOrKusZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fleetfeet-com.html><span>←</span><span>Fleet Feet coupons - $60 OFF in July 2024</span></a>
