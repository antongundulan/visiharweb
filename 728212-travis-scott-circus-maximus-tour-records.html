In just a few short weeks, we are already seeing how much a of smash hit this tour is going to be.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the graphic below on Twitter from Jah Talks Music, we are to expect that Travis is going to be a lot richer. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Even with a show being canceled,</a> it is going to rake in tons of sales. Personally, this is La Flame's largest-selling tour ever with well over 500,000 tickets purchased. However, there is more than just that.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-travis-scott-is-coming-for-the-throne>Travis Scott Is Coming For The Throne</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Final sales projections are looking at around $80 million gross. Additionally, roughly $1 million a night is coming from just merch sales at the shows. Another impressive feat is that he is the first to sell out the SoFi Stadium. For context, there are around 70,000 plus seats! Last but not least, "the average per show gross sales were ahead of tours from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kendrick Lamar</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>J. Cole</a>, Olivia Rodrigo, Harry Styles, and Tyler The Creator." These are some of the biggest names right now and to pull that off is something special.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your initial thoughts on Travis Scott's Circus Maximus tour setting and breaking these records?
