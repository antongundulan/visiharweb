There's a lot to unpack here, from Luigi's arranged courtship to that rude question about Daisy, but boy, that final answer.<h2>Does Daisy like Wario?</h2>As revealed by @MarioBrothBlog, in the German version of Mario Party 5, the pairing of Wario and Daisy is referred to as "Heimlich Liebende," which translates in English to "secret lovers." Scandalous!<h2>Who is Princess Daisy boyfriend?</h2>Daisy and Luigi have been portrayed as a couple since NES Open Tournament Golf where Daisy takes the role of being Luigi's caddie.<h2>10 DARK SECRETS About Waluigi Nintendo Tried To Hide</h2><p></p><h2>Is there a Wario version of Peach?</h2>Princess Daisy is the ruler of Sarasaland and the cousin of Princess Peach. She is also a rival of Wario and Waluigi in various sports games and Luigi's "love interest".<h2>Is Rosalina Luigi's daughter?</h2>Luigi is known to be left-handed—a trait that would be dominant to two parents that both have this preference. Perhaps during the time reset when the Year of Luigi had taken place, that is when Peach and Luigi had been together and had given birth to Rosalina.<h2>Why is Warios nose pink?</h2>Wario's nose is pink because he's frequently huffing garlic fumes.<h2>Who is Princess Peach dating?</h2>Princess Peach has been seen as Mario's romantic interest for decades. She has been showing more hints of her feelings, but they're not as obvious as Mario. In the Super Mario Bros.: Peach-hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen! animated film, it's revealed that Peach already has a boyfriend, the Prince of the Flower Kingdom.<h2>Why did Mario and Pauline break up?</h2>Princess Peach - She is a full reason of why Mario broke up with Pauline. Pauline was replaced after finding out people think that Peach made the debut in Donkey Kong and not her. Peach and Pauline used to have this rivalry until Pauline's graduation from Josh's Anger Management. They were friends once again.<h2>What is Toad's real name?</h2>Toad, also known as (Kinopio キノピオ in Japanese), is a humanoid mushroom that is both a single character and the collective name of the "Mushroom People" found in the Mushroom Kingdom. The Toad species first appeared in Super Mario Bros. as seven guards that serve Princess Peach, called Mushroom Retainers.<h2>Is Mario Wario?</h2>The most popular one was that Wario and Mario were cousins. But that's not the case. Wario and Mario were actually just childhood rivals, and the two share no blood relation.<h2>Is Shokora dead?</h2>Yes, she's dead. Here's a closer look at the last Wario sees of her in the game, during the ending sequence. She ascends in a beam of light, is carried/supported by four small angels, and even has a halo herself. This is all heavenly imagery, but also notice her posture, and the fact she's closing her eyes.<h2>Why does Rosalina cover her eye?</h2>"When I was a kid, I was playing with a stick on a camping trip with my grandparents, and I accidentally cut my face", Rosalina said, "there wasn't any damage to my eye, but it left this awful scar, so when school started back up, I started wearing my hair down to cover my scar, and I've been doing it ever since."<h2>Who is Baby Rosalina's dad?</h2>Mario is the Father of Peach and Rosalina, and is the King of the Mushroom Kingdom.<h2>What Does Wario smell like?</h2>The smell is a mix of tsukemono (pickled vegetables), raw eggs, carassius sushi. Try smelling it! The holy grail. This isn't the only reference to toilet humor either. In the second page of answers, Wario jokes about fart explosions (I'm not kidding!).<h2>Is Peach in love with Mario?</h2>Mario. Mario obviously cares a lot about Peach as he's willing to rescue her countless times. Although neither character has outwardly expressed their affections for each other, it can be assumed that Peach does in fact love Mario for his bravery and determination.<h2>Who is Rosalina married to?</h2>She is a human who was born and raised in outer space by two green aliens, and it's possible but yet to be confirmed that she still lives with them. She is the adoptive mother of Jeffy. On October 27, 2017, Rosalina became the wife of Mario.<h2>Who is Super Mario's wife?</h2>Daisy made her debut in Super Mario Land as the damsel-in-distress. Daisy will appear at the end of the game after the player defeats Tatanga.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8OoZLCZop68bq3NnWSwmZyqtqi1jKGYr51dpb%2BqusKeqqydow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./do-guys-find-long-hair-more-attractive.html><span>←</span><span>Do guys find long hair more attractive?</span></a>
