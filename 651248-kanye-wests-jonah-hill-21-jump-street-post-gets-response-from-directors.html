<span>Tandra Barner</span></p><h1>Kanye West's Jonah Hill &amp;amp; &amp;quot;21 Jump Street&amp;quot; Post Gets Response From Directors</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hotnewhiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design-7-6.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><a href=# class=text-word rel>Kanye West</a>'s return to Instagram, thanking Jonah Hill in the film 21 Jump Street for making him "<a href=# rel>like Jewish people again</a>" got a response from the film's directors. Moreover, it was a pretty weird and still incredibly tone deaf post that caused many to clown or further criticize him. Still, as many fans pointed out, he could've said much worse. "Watching Jonah Hill in 21 Jump street made me like Jewish people again," the Chicago rapper wrote. "No one should take anger against one or two individuals and transform that into hatred towards millions of innocent people. No Christian can be labeled antisemite knowing Jesus is Jew. Thank you Jonah Hill I love you."</p><p>Furthermore, both Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (who directed the film) had cheeky, brief, and comical responses to Ye's proclamation. "Um... thanks for watching?" Miller tweeted with a screenshot of the post in question. On his end, Lord retweeted and replied to a tweet asking if there's anything the directing duo can't do. "<a href=# rel>Laughter is the best medicine</a>," Phil commented in response. However, Hill hasn't spoken on that message yet, presumably because he doesn't have social media.</p><span><h2 id=h-21-jump-street-directors-respond-to-kanye-west>"21 Jump Street" Directors Respond To Kanye West</h2></span><p>Of course, it was only a matter of time before Kanye made some form of a comeback on social media, if only in the literal sense. He's been laying relatively low for the past few months, with his most discussed behavior being his <a href=# rel>paparazzi interactions</a> while <a href=# rel>out with wife Bianca Censori</a>. While he's not making the explosive and combative statements that sent public goodwill through a downward spiral, this seemed backhanded to many out there. More than that, it doesn't indicate any understanding of wrongdoing, although it's the typical Gram antic from the <a href=# class=text-word rel="nofollow noopener">Yeezy</a> mogul at this point.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Amber Rose</a> and Julia Fox both <a href=# rel>shared their experiences dating</a> the 45-year old on the latter's Forbidden Fruits podcast. Moreover, they discussed his tendency to make everything about him, whether it's playing his music all the time or being the most well-known person in the room. Regardless, it's clear that some of that attitude translates into him believing his Jonah Hill shout-out was warranted. Check out Miller's response below and, for the latest news and updates on Kanye West, stick around on HNHH.</p><span><h2 id=h-ye-s-jonah-hill-shoutout-gets-response-from-phil-lord-christopher-miller>Ye's Jonah Hill Shoutout Gets Response From Phil Lord & Christopher Miller</h2></span><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">[via]</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdman5zgJdmopqmqZp6uLHSrapmop%2Bjrql5x6KjpWViZnqrwcypZKysopqytXnPqKqtZZeawbR50Z6qqaeeqLJustGopGacmaeypMDOq6o%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./judge-joe-brown-slams-cbs-434900.html><span>←</span><span>Judge Joe Brown Slams CBS for Hollywood Trick Economics (Exclusive)</span></a>
