A US couple have died while attempting a &#34;highly dangerous&#34; wood-burning technique that's recently gained popularity on TikTok.
The bodies of James Carolfi, 52, and Tanya Rodriguez, 44, were found after a house fire at their Wisconsin property on April 6.
According to local police, the couple had died before the fire started, having been electrocuted while attempting &#34;"><meta name=author content="Kelle Repass"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
