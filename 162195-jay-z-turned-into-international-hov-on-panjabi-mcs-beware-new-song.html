In Jay-Z's book,&nbsp;Decoded, he explained how he ended up on the remix which was released in 2003. Although the first verse opens up on more of a party vibe, Jay-Z does take a political route on the song when he addresses the Iraq war.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"It wasn’t like anything else playing. The bass line was propulsive and familiar, but it took me a second to realize it was from the theme song of&nbsp;Knight Rider. All I knew was it was something totally fresh. It felt like world music in the best sense," he explained in Decoded. "I wanted to make a party song, but the international feeling of the track&nbsp; -- which some people thought was Arabic -- moved me into a different direction. So I dropped a line against the Iraq war."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics<br></strong></span>It's International Hov,&nbsp;been having a flow<br>Before Bin Laden got Manhattan to blow<br>Before Ronald Reagan got Manhattan the blow<br>Before I was cabbing it there back and forth<br>Raw we had it all day, Papi in the hallway<br>Cop one on consignment to give you more yay</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
