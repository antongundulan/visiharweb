Fortunately, it looks like another Atlanta native will help him on that journey in 2024, too. Moreover, Faye Webster just released a new song and music video with Lil Boat titled "Lego Ring," and it's a very sweet and balanced cut with a lot of personality. In the visual, both artists play a Rock Band-like rhythm game in a living room with a drum set and guitar, a game which you can actually play online <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">here</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, Faye Webster's light and airy croon matches up very well with Lil Yachty's high-pitched vibrato, and their vocal effects here go to great lengths to make this a very dreamy song. After all, she is one of Steve Lacy's main <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">inspirations</a>; how could this be anything less than an alt-indie-R&B jam packed with charisma? Not only that, but there's some well-produced distortion effects here that give this typically breezy and summery cut a shoegaze-like grit. Actually, it goes pretty far to brand this duo's unique approach to indie and rock styles, as it's something that many other bands and musicians attempt to much more jarring results. Of course, it's quite the cheeky cut, with lyrics that could be as dumbed-down as they are profound.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-faye-webster-s-lego-ring-with-lil-yachty-stream-amp-watch-the-music-video>Faye Webster's "Lego Ring" With Lil Yachty: Stream & Watch The Music Video</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, we can't wait to hear Faye Webster's new album Underdressed at the Symphony, which comes out on March 1 with a "Lego Ring" attached.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnan9zf49mnZqxlWLEpq7SrZyrZZyatLB50aKloGWcnrluxcCcn62xXaOyuHnSqKWgZZ2qwKqvjK%2BgnZ2fYsC1vsSapGagmaV6qbvPZqWer6M%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kenneth-cole.html><span>←</span><span>Kenneth Cole - Biography</span></a>
