One that suggests: "I fuc*ed up." Yet such is not the way that <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Pump</a> operates. In fact, his ever-expanding collection of charges seems to be growing with every passing month.&nbsp;Yesterday, Pump found himself catching heat from the long arm of the law, after TSA found an&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">abundance of drugs</a> in his luggage.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Though it was unclear whether the discovery would yield any legal consequence, it would appear that police have been growing impatient with Pump's reckless behavior. Not long after the news broke, a new mugshot has emerged to see the light of day. In it, Pump seems to be immensely satisfied with himself, smiling as if to suggest a deeper hidden meaning. In reality, the man can make light all he wants. Yet the sad truth is, withdrawals will feel all the more difficult from within jail&nbsp;walls.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It's sad to see a young artist show such reckless disregard for his own well-being, and the idea that Pump would be proud of this is difficult to comprehend. Yet such a course of action appears to be this way; after all, he's come this far.&nbsp; "1985, I arrived," rapped <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>J. Cole</a>, on "1985," "33 years, damn I'm grateful I survived." With that in mind, we can only hope the young rapper comes to realize that some things should not be taken for granted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhaoN4gZZmo6KkXaXCrryMpaaoo6NiwKLAyKydop2UYsSqwMdmn6Klo5q5p3nIp2Snnadiuraz0qGmrWWemsS0</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./functional-beverages-drinks-review-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Kin Euphorics, Ghia, Aplos, More</span></a>
