In an interview on <a href=#>"CBS This Morning,"</a> Gwyneth Paltrow didn't share any details about her 18-year-old daughter's choice of university or field of study, but she did say of the milestone, "I know this sounds nuts, but it feels almost as profound as giving birth."</p><p dir=ltr>For the record, Apple's birth wasn't just "profound" — it was also an incredibly harrowing ordeal. Paltrow told <a href=#>ABC News</a> that she experienced an unnamed emergency during her 70-hour labor. "It was a traumatic experience. I won't lie," she said. But for the new mom, meeting her daughter made it all worthwhile. "I came out of it thinking, 'Well, I would have amputated my legs for her.' So that [labor] was nothing," she said.</p><p dir=ltr>These days, Paltrow seems to be thinking a lot about Apple's future and who she has become. As far as her interests are concerned, she told <a href=#>People</a> that Apple is a pro at doing makeup and loves fashion. "I'm just like, 'What is this child here to do?" Paltrow said on the <a href=#>"Literally! With Rob Lowe"</a> podcast. "She's so bright and so funny." And in March, Paltrow took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to praise Apple for shaping her into the person she is now. "This woman gives me hope for the future of sisterhood, and for the future of our planet," she wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhiaoR2go6grrKmlam1brzApaurp6eoerOxwJyroqeeYsGwecOarKCgpJq%2Fbq3PqaOeZaOprrPAyKeeZpufobmms8RmoKxlmqrAtXnWoZitZamkwqV5xLGnnpukZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ftrs-contract-status-after-their-return-at-aew-revolution.html><span>←</span><span>FTRs Contract Status After Their Return at AEW Revolution</span></a>
