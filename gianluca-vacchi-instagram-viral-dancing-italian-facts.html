When he's not riding horses shirtless with the alum, the Italian tycoon, 48, heads up the manufacturing company SEA Società Europea Autocaravan and shares his luxurious adventures on Instagram.</p><p id=e082vTBXtHH data-wc=24>From his adrenaline-seeking ways to his love of pajamas, here is everything you need to know about the eccentric businessman and his 'GV Lifestyle.'</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=e-nJ6LP-DlKR data-wc=60><strong>1. He's best friends with Zac Efron</strong>The actor lived with Gianluca back in 2014 while the duo vacationed in Italy. The pair enjoyed shirtless horseback rides on the beach, danced on tables to Jason Derulo's "Wiggle" and showed off their synchronized diving skills from glamorous yacht. If that's not a bromance then we don't know what is!</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eh3GZ749ZWXF data-wc=50>At the time, Zac professed his adoration for the businessman on <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a>, sharing a solo shot of Gianluca with a caption that <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>read</a>: "To my friend @gianlucavacchi – the real life 'most interesting man in the world', never above you, never below – always by your side. Luv and respect.'"</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eck3Zb5CCxBO data-wc=53><strong>2. He's a lifestyle guru</strong>When you've branded your lifestyle with its own personal name, you know you're doing something right! As evidenced by his social media, Gianluca lives a life of which many dream, lounging on lavish yachts, riding a Harley Davidson and traveling via private jet with his Hermes luggage in tow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/06c360eca7a5-body11-z.jpg><p id=eSydSJUU1CAX style=text-align:center data-wc=2>Photo: Instagram/@gianlucavacchi</p><p id=ezjoNcBkoK8l data-wc=53>He's also not afraid of getting his fine Italian threads wet when it comes to riding a jet ski at the beach. Attached to a video of him playing with the sea-faring toy, he wrote, "In life it doesn't matter what you drive, is how you drive it that makes the difference. Enjoy."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eUcoLBG1edSn data-wc=61><strong>3. He loves his pajamas</strong>While he's rolling in the dough, Gianluca can appreciate the simple things in life - like a pair of comfortable loungewear. The businessman has shared a number of photos hanging around his pool deck in his printed pajama shirts and trousers. On one occasion he noted, "Always pajamas to go on the boat or on the beach."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0e10149e1070-body53-z.jpg><p id=evKWGpFh9NrO data-wc=57><strong>4. He's an adrenaline junkie</strong>When it comes to his lifestyle, the Internet star likes to live on the wild side. The action man has taken riding his motorcycle to new heights, standing on top of his Harley Davidson's seat — while wearing pajamas, naturally — as the bike was still in motion, cruising down a curved hillside.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eIpgwkjZvPbG data-wc=47>Gianluca's daredevil ways have also played out on the high seas with his "<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>crazy sailing</a>" – hanging off a boat's boom. Apart from his adventurous activities above sea level, the Italian tycoon has also taken his intrepid antics below the surface with underwater cycling in a pool.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eY3gCbsr7HXt data-wc=50><strong>5. He can dance!</strong>No surprise since his impressive moves are what propelled him into the spotlight. Whether he's doing La Samba in a tuxedo by a pool or shaking it in a swimsuit to Pitbull's "Echa Pa'lla (Maños Pa' Arriba)," this businessman lets his fancy footwork do all the talking.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=e2TZec3ytD-M data-wc=8>(Bonus) Because we can't get enough of this:</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
