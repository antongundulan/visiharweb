In this capacity, he had a <a href=#>substantial impact on shaping the company’s direction</a>. In spite of his firing, TNA’s management is still getting more reorganization even now.</p><p>Anthem Sports & Entertainment Inc. created a buzz in the wrestling community by appointing Anthony Cicione as the new President of TNA Wrestling, displacing the longstanding President Scott D’Amore. D’Amore’s departure marked the end of an era, where he played a pivotal role in guiding TNA through various changes and challenges.</p><p>In 2017, D’Amore and current AEW talent Don Callis were appointed co-executive vice presidents alongside Ed Nordholm, who held the position of President. Callis departed Impact in 2021 to join AEW, leaving D’Amore as the sole EVP before assuming the role of President of Impact Wrestling just under a year ago. Nordholm continued to be involved with TNA under D’Amore’s leadership.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Haus of Wrestling</a>, it was reported that Ed Nordholm, while still an executive at Anthem Sports & Entertainment, is no longer actively involved with the TNA brand. Although he remains an Anthem executive, Nordholm has ceased working directly with TNA. During the announcement of D’Amore’s departure and Cicione’s promotion, Nordholm participated in his Anthem executive capacity.</p><p>Sources noted Nordholm’s close association with D’Amore, revealing that the decision for him to step back from TNA was made several weeks ago, likely coinciding with D’Amore’s exit planning. It has also been conveyed that Nordholm is no longer engaged in Anthem’s sports-related activities.</p><p>Scott D’Amore’s <a href=#>TNA firing was also in the works long before it was officially announced</a>. In the aftermath of his termination, reports emerged detailing the circumstances surrounding D’Amore’s firing,&nbsp;<a href=#>including his unsuccessful attempt to purchase TNA</a>. We will have to wait and see what will become of TNA Wrestling in the end.</p><p>What do you think of this story concerning TNA Wrestling? Do you feel more changes will take place soon?
