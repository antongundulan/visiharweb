There's something energizing about its scent that gets me up and going in the morning, and yet, it's also incredibly soothing, making it perfect for my wind-down showers before bedtime.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a self-proclaimed eucalyptus snob, it's difficult to find a product that smells like the real thing. More often than not, candles, body lotions, et al. smell artificial and cheap. However, Nécessaire's Eucalyptus collection comes as close to the real deal as there is — and I'm obsessed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The body wash has me in a particular chokehold. Just one squeeze of the gel-like formula makes me take a deep inhale and exhale — it smells so good. If I close my eyes while I lather it over my body, I feel ten times more relaxed than when I stepped in the shower — and I'm not the only one who feels similarly. My partner, who rarely gives me feedback on the products I fill our shower with, has started hogging it and even asks me not to use too much of "his" body wash. (Eye roll, but also lol.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Apart from its delicious scent, we love its vitamin-packed formula. It's packed with niacinamide, vitamins A, C, and E, omega-6 and -9, and a handful of plant surfactants. Together, these ingredients work to effectively cleanse, nourish, and soften the skin. Plus, it's hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop:</strong> $25, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We're also on a journey to "greenify" our lives as much as we comfortably can, so Nécessaire's sustainability efforts are another factor in our love for this body wash. For starters, the bottle is made from 100% sugarcane, and instead of having a pump which is nearly impossible to recycle, it has a twist-off cap that opens a small hole at the top for product disposal that's made from mixed resin ABS/PP.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As if that weren't enough, the body wash is shipped in an eco-friendly way. The carton is made from 85% post-consumer waste and is FSC-certified. Nécessaire also has partnerships with sustainable companies such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>TerraCycle</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>1% For The Planet</a>, and it's certified climate-neutral and plastic-neutral.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: This Exfoliating Body Bar Changed My Mind About Bar Soap</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Considering the shared love my partner and I have for this body wash, it's sure to have a permanent spot on our shelf. And while I may have to fight with him on who gets the last drop, thankfully, I get to enjoy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Nécessaire's Eucalyptus Body Exfoliator</a> all to myself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1opZ6blajAorXRnmStoJVir7Cw2GaumquYYr%2Bmwsierg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natalie-riedmann-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>Natalie Riedmann Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
