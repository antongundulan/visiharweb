In scenarios that Midge could probably relate to, Danny contends with coming home from a three-month gig and his dog not recognizing him, imploring a journalist friend to write an article about him to drum up some good publicity, and losing out on a studio contract because he won’t get a nose job.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The series received glowing reviews, with THR proclaiming in 1954 that “very few shows can even sporadically match the consistent warmth and gentle humor of this family series.” When Hagen left after season three, the writers made Danny a widower and the show was renamed The Danny Thomas Show. It would go on to score 17 total Emmy noms and five wins over 11 seasons. Maisel, for its part, has scored 80 nominations — including 14 this year — and 20 wins over five seasons.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">This story first appeared in an August stand-alone issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
