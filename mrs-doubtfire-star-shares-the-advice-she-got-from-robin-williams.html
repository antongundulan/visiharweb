"He was very insistent in making sure that I knew that substances were not going to help," she added. Jakub thought that the advice she was given by Williams was "a really good message to hear, because that does tend to be a well-worn path for a lot of kid actors."</p><p dir=ltr>Jakub is now "paying forward" Williams' advice by teaching mental health workshops to help others dealing with mental health issues on how to cope after quitting acting in 2000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWplbX92e8yrqmacn6qvtbLIq5xmq6SWv26%2Fx5qpnqtdqbWmecCdraKblWLAqbGMoKatZZanvK550aiZoqZdrLatuMiapKxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meaning-of-psycho-killer-by-duran-duran.html><span>←</span><span>Meaning of Psycho Killer by Duran Duran</span></a>
