<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>LL Cool J Returning With First Album In Over A Decade, Announces New Single</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hotnewhiphop.com/imgprst/2292x1200-fit-81-auto/2024/06/LL-Cool-J-New-Album-Single-Announcement-Hip-Hop-News-1-2362x1575.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">One of hip-hop's most enduring and long-standing legends is making his return to the studio booth after over ten years of radio silence on the full-length front. Moreover, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>LL Cool J</a> recently confirmed that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his new album</a> is coming this fall, and announced a new single titled "Saturday Night Special" on Friday (June 7). It will come out on June 14, and the New York icon also let fans know that they will get the features, tracklist, and the whole shebang before the LP's release. Overall, this is pretty exciting for old-school rap fans and LL Stans alike, and for younger generations who haven't lived through one of his major album cycles.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, LL Cool J's last album was Authentic back in 2013, his 13th studio project that also marked his first since his Def Jam departure. It saw a No. 23 debut on the Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 14,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It's been a long time since the "Mama Said Knock You Out" MC was in the headlines primarily for his new music or moves. After all, one of the most prevailing narratives among the newer generation around him is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">whether he's better looking</a> than another classic and thirsted-over lyricist: <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Method Man</a>.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ll-cool-j-announces-new-music-plans>LL Cool J Announces New Music Plans</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Jokes aside, this new move from LL Cool J is quite exciting but also very curious given his thoughts on other hip-hop legends coming through with new albums. Well, it seems like this is fine as long as they're rap-related. For example, he recently <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">voiced his disappointment</a> in André 3000's ambient/New Age album New Blue Sun due to the fact that the Outkast creative isn't giving fans what they expect from him. However, this argument was framed as more of a discussion on how 3 Stacks' talents for lyricism are being squandered, but it's not that black and white.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Regardless, we look forward to LL Cool J's new album and hope it brings him a lot of success, fulfillment, satisfaction, and joy on the personal front. We'll be here to listen and share that joy, just like LL was there to share the godfather of hip-hop, DJ Kool Herc's, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">induction in the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame</a>. It's great to see rap of all generations get love in today's media landscape. It reminds us that we need this balance, and that our greats are always worthy of our praise, attention, and interest.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop.

Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre.

As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoZoBzgJJmo6Vlk6S8rXnJZqWer12WuaPBzGaqoqaXobJurc2npq6mk5q6prrTZp%2BiqF2dvLF5zZ6urA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leva-bonaparte-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Leva Bonaparte Net Worth 2024</span></a>
