They're filter feeders&nbsp;— like some whales of the mammal variety&nbsp;— swimming along with their mouths open, scooping up plankton and very small fishy members of the neighborhood. They're often described as docile, and some will allow a human swimmer to hold on for a brief ride.</p><p>Whale sharks prefer tropical waters, but sadly, they're particularly desirable in parts of Asia and in Oman. They can grow up to about 40 feet long, which is&nbsp;about the size of a standard-issue school bus. Slow, docile, meaty ... kind of reminds you of the <a href=#>now-extinct dodo bird</a>, doesn't it? So it makes some sense that they're wanted by fishermen. "Honey, I only caught one, but golly! What a fish!" Their meat is highly valued, especially their fins. And according to traditional Asian beliefs, other parts of the whale shark are said to have medicinal applications.</p><p>Conservation efforts are underway, however. There's even a <a href=#>program</a> in Singapore that lets school children "adopt" a whale shark. It's not <a href=#>Free Willy</a>, but it's a start.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9l3Fra3BfqbWmedGemKVlopqutLvNZq6hmZyaerS0wKuirGWRp7Jusc2dmKeflaeypXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mufasa-lion-king-cinemacon-trailer-1235872374.html><span>←</span><span>The Lion King' Trailer Hits CinemaCon</span></a>
