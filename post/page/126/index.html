American Idol season 12 contestant Matthew Farmer has admitted that his story of suffering from a traumatic war injury was a fabrication.
Farmer, a handsome 26-year-old singer, seemed like a lock for the Idol crown. He had a strong audition, scoring points by bringing in his cute daughter, Cadence, and telling a compelling story of military service and receiving a life-threatening injury in Kuwait.

What’s the story?Founded in 2002 by biochemist Bryan Johns and Alec Call – and still privately owned – iS Clinical is part of the Innovative Skincare umbrella, which creates products focused on pure, pharmaceutical-grade ingredients.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>10 blsamos labiales con proteccin solar para el da a da</h2><time>Aug 10, 2024</time>
