<a href=../../../what-is-a-decent-credit-score-to-buy-a-car.html></a>

A credit score of 600 won't necessarily keep you from getting an auto loan, but it's likely to make that loan more expensive.

chiflado is a word that means “mad person.”
Aside from that, what exactly is a Chiflada? According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the adjective meaning “mad” or “nuts.” 2) The word “crazy person” refers to a maniac. They’re both somewhat correct, but not completely. To me, the word chiflado, whether as a noun or as an adjective, implies “spoiled.”
