Spade Cooley may be a footnote in the annals of country music these days, but during his heyday in the 1950s he was a major star, known for his virtuosity on the fiddle and his uncanny resemblance to singing cowboy Roy Rogers (Cooley, in fact, served as Rogers' stand-in for several of his big-screen westerns). With a hit TV show and a popular stage act, Cooley's fame at the time was recognized when he was awarded his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Clayton Mathile Net Worth</h2><time>Aug 5, 2024</time>

Colin Cowherd has some bold takes about Kevin Durant after game 1 of Suns vs. Timberwolves. Kevin Durant and the Phoenix Suns lost their game-one matchup against the Minnesota Timberwolves 95 to 120. Anthony Edwards led the Wolves to their blowout win, scoring 33 points and grabbing 9 boards in a statement win. The young star made sure to let Kevin Durant know he had his way.

Dear FRONTLINE,
I found it disturbing that this episode began with the question "What went wrong with the once great LAPD?" and answered it with minorities. The old image of the LAPD was represented by white characters from Dragnet and Adam 12 as if these shows were accurate portrayals of how things worked "before Affirmative Action." There was no real examination of the history of the LAPD. I am not trying to excuse the actions of the corrupt police officers in your program, but this report seemed very biased against Blacks and Hispanics.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Eclectic Style Clothing Is Trending</h2><time>Aug 5, 2024</time>
