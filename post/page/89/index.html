<a href=../../../american-pie-presents-girls-rules-film-review-4075549.html></a>
American Pie debuted when I was in fifth grade, and like Blink-182 and South Park before it, the high school sex comedy quickly ascended to the pantheon of raunchy, outrageous and forbidden content that was immediately gobbled up and then regurgitated ad nauseum by every tween in my elementary school. (Imagine how disappointed/relieved I was to find real-life high school as tame as a saltine cracker.) Millennials like myself grew up on this comedy classic of late-90s cinema, which launched not only three canonical sequels, but also an array of direct-to-video spinoff movies that attempt to summon the sweet-n-spicy spirit of the original.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>&amp;quot;First Take&amp;quot; Celebrate Success Of Stephen A.
