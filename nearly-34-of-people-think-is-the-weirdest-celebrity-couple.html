However, the two were apparently a genuine couple and have even gone on to <a href=#>have a child together</a>. But that doesn't mean that they're a normal pair by any means. In fact, 33.65% of people who took Nicki Swift's survey feel like they are the weirdest celebrity couple around. Cosmo even claimed that "[t]hey're basically the Romeo and Juliet of our time." Bold assertion? *Nods head vigorously.* Honestly, though, while the comparison to classic Shakespearian star-crossed lovers is definitely debatable, there's certainly no denying that they're an unexpected, if intriguing, pair.</p><p dir=ltr>Although some people might be upset that their relationship is considered to be weird, Musk and Grimes would likely be thrilled by the distinction. That's because they have both found success by being different. Musk is a man set on <a href=#>living on Mars</a> while Grimes is a singer who creates <a href=#>alien-worthy music with a supervillain-like aesthetic</a>. And as strange as you might think Grimes' art really is, she admitted to <a href=#>The Guardian</a>, "In my life, I'm a lot more weird than this."&nbsp;Of course, that can be proven by the fact that Musk and Grimes <a href=#>named their son X Æ A-Xii</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Yeah, they're not a typical pair and that seems to be just the way that they like it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGtjaYF3e82emKukqWKAdXnOn2SpnZ%2BluaZ506Ggp6NdnsBuwMeeZLCdmaexpr%2FTZpqepJWXv6rA2GaaqK2gobJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matthew-perry-romantic-life-history-insights-from-friends-lovers-and-all-that-terrible-stuff.html><span>←</span><span>Matthew Perry Romantic Life History Insights From Friends, Lovers, And All That Terrible Stuff</span></a>
