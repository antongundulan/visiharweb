The first movie I saw that really inspired me was Paper Moon with Tatum O’Neal. There was something about her being so young and being able to accomplish so much in that movie – I thought she was so smart and quick.

There’s something so effortless about that movie. It’s so organic and spontaneous. I just can’t imagine a script that well written.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>What’s your most overrated film?</strong></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>In terms of genre, I don’t necessarily go out of my way to see westerns, which is weird because I’ve been in a couple. I had never seen one before I made [True Grit]. I guess I enjoy being in them rather than watching them.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Favourite director?</strong></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>As a fan, Christopher Nolan, and in terms of people I’ve worked with, the Coen brothers.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>What’s your favourite environment for watching films?</strong></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>It depends on my mood. I love being at home and just watching a movie in my room, but I also love the idea of getting friends together and going to the cinema.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>What’s your favourite film snack?</strong></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Sour Patch Watermelons every time.
