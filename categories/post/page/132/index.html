Answer
Cantabile [kantabile] is an Italian term that literally translates as “singable” or “songlike” in the context of music. Cantabile is sometimes used interchangeably with “cantando” (singing) by 18th-century composers, and it denotes a measured speed as well as flexible, legato playing.
Another issue is, at what pace does Cantabile operate? There are 42 beats per minute (Largo) in this song, which translates to 14 measures/bars per minute.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Solomon Pena?
