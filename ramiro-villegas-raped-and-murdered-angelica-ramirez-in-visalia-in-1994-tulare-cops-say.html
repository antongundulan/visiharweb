She stepped away to use the restroom and vanished.</p><p>Within a couple of hours, investigators had launched a massive search for the child. “I remember that day because I also was assigned the search and I remember that desperate feeling we had in trying to locate this young girl,” Boudreaux said.</p><p>Two days later, a farm laborer found her body in a canal, and the missing-persons case became a homicide investigation.</p><p>“Since that day, the Tulare County Sheriff’s Office has had detectives assigned to this case,” Boudreaux said.</p><p>The sheriff said that over the course of almost three decades, investigators followed up thousands of leads, looked into hundreds of persons of interest, grilled hundreds of potential suspects, and conducted nearly 1,000 interviews with anyone who might know something.</p><p>They did have DNA collected from the scene and submitted it to databases 100 times without a hit, even as testing grew more and more sophisticated over the years.</p><p>In February, after consulting with the FBI forensic genealogy unit, the sheriff’s office contracted with a private lab that created a genetic profile of the killer.</p><p>That was then uploaded to public databases that people use to trace their family trees and in March they got a match.</p><p>“We knew we were within two generations of where the suspect fell in that family tree,” Sgt. Joshua Lowry said.</p><p>Further comparison between the relatives in that family and the suspect’s DNA led police to zero in on five male siblings living in Southern California. Four submitted DNA and were ruled out as suspects.</p><p>The fifth, Romiro Villegas, could not be tested. After a drug-trafficking arrest in 2002, he was deported to Mexico, where he died of a lung ailment in 2014.</p><p>“DNA was never collected from him,” Boudreaux said.</p><p>The sheriff said he had spent two days with Angelica’s family, walking them through the investigation and explaining why they were sure Villegas was the man who sexually assaulted and strangled her.</p><p>“If there is any solace, we know that he is dead and I think that he’s in a special place and certain place,” Boudreaux said. “But we know Angelica is in heaven.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfp66utdGoZK%2BhnKGyqK3SZqmaqJWZeqK6w2akrqqUmr%2BmsIyapaCdnJ6wonnRmqSiqpWveqq6jK%2BgrJmcnq5utc1maHJxZGLBtrjAq5xmm5%2BlwG6%2FwLI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./radu-spinghel-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Radu Spinghel Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
