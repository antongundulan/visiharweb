Case in point? On Wednesday, the actress shared a short clip of her breaking it down to Dua Lipa’s single from the film, “Dance the Night” — and the only thing that would’ve made it better is a jumpsuit-clad Ken hip thrusting alongside her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the video, Mendes started at the top of a staircase (in front of a picturesque grassy landscape) before descending to the beat of the music while incorporating a bit of choreography with the skirt of her dress. As if that wasn’t dreamy enough on its own, the actress’s bright green maxidress, which featured a bustier sweetheart neckline, thick straps, and streaks of pink, yellow, and blue, gave major cottagecore vibes that perfectly matched the scenery of her solo flash mob.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eva completed the look by wearing her fiery red hair down in voluminous waves with a side part and by adding a bright pink lip color, and she opted to go barefoot while grooving to the music.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Why must I make that stupid pout when I start to dance ?!” she captioned the video. “Anyone suffer from this seriously lame condition? 💗”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Eva wasn’t present at any of her partner’s Barbie red carpets earlier this summer (the couple has long been open about how they prefer to do professional events alone), this isn’t the first time that she’s found a way to subtly support her beau.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Instagram/eva mendes</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in May, the A-lister shared a trio of snaps that showed her posing in white Barbie-themed baby tee covered in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>giant photo of Gosling dressed as Ken</a>. “​​Got that real big Kenergy. Coz girls is players too,” she captioned the post.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xK%2BYZqWVo7Gmv4ydmKeblWLBqbGMp6CgoKRitq%2B%2F05qeq5mdYsOqsMSoZHBtZm5%2FdYQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dancing-on-ice-judge-christopher-deans-ultra-rare-photos-of-two-grown-up-sons-are-so-sweet.html><span>←</span><span>Christopher Dean's ultra-rare photos of two grown-up sons are so sweet</span></a>
