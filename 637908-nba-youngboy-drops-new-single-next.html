There’s no doubt that YB is one of the biggest rappers right now, ascending to the top through an organic buzz. The influx of music he’s dropped through YouTube turned him into one of the biggest artists on the platform while amassing millions of fans worldwide and transforming into a generational talent with an indelible imprint on the rap game.</p><p>The rapper released roughly eight projects altogether in 2022 with the majority of these efforts arriving in the latter half of the year. Projects like The Last Slimeto and Ma’ I Got A Family helped <a href=# rel>close out his deal with Atlantic Records</a> before beginning a new chapter of his career with Motown Records. He already blessed fans with<a href=# rel> I Rest My Case</a> earlier this year, which found him diving into the <a href=# class=text-word rel>Playboi Carti</a>-esque lane a bit deeper. However, with a new project on the way, the rapper has fans anticipating his next move.</p><span><h2 id=h-nba-youngboy-next>NBA Youngboy - “Next”</h2></span><p>With Don’t Try This At Home expected to drop in the near future, NBA Youngboy sets the tone with the release of his latest single, “Next.” The rapper returns with an exhilarating banger that finds him pushing back at his competition and flaunting his wealth. However, it also showcases his growth, from producing street-centric bangers to trying to appeal to a much wider audience than before. It’s a party anthem that provides us with a bit of insight into what we should expect from him on Don’t Try This At Home.&nbsp;</p><p>NBA Youngboy shared details about his forthcoming album during his recent interview with Rap Radar. Following the launch of his "Stop The Violence" campaign, he explained that he was going to really talk his sh*t on his upcoming effort. However, he doesn't want his fans to try and mimic his actions. "“I’mma be talking crazy on there,” he said of the project. “I’mma show you Murda Man… but I’m lettin’ you know, though: Don’t try this at home."</p><p><strong>Quotable Lyrics</strong><br>I make all these bitches come and take it off, boss shit<br>Got that bitch doin' right, buy that bitch a outfit<br>I ain't have red on the first night, told the bitch blue this shit<br>I want head on the first night, I can make her mouth fit</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaIR6fJdmpZuZXa68trrGm6ayZZSnvLG%2FjKecsGWjnruouMRmpZ6wpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./my-man-is-cupid-episode-3-release-date-recap-cast-review-spoilers-schedule-where-to-watch-everything-we-know.html><span>←</span><span>My Man is Cupid Episode 3 Release Date, Recap, Cast, Review, Spoilers, Schedule, Where To Watch &amp;amp; Ev</span></a>
