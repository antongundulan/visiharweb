Based on the previous chapter, we can try to guess and imagine what will happen next.</p><p>In Chapter 44, we see that Rosaline and Romeo finally meet face-to-face after seven years of separation. Rosaline was shocked and angry to see him alive and well, while Romeo was surprised and happy to see her and their son. Romeo tried to explain his reasons for faking his death and leaving her, but Rosaline refused to listen and slapped him hard. She accused him of being a liar, a traitor, and a coward, and told him to stay away from her and their son.</p><p>She also revealed that she was engaged to Paris, a nobleman who loved her and her son. Romeo was devastated and heartbroken by her words and begged her to give him another chance. He said that he still loved her and that he only wanted to protect her from the dangers of his family and their enemies. He also said that he wanted to be a father to their son and that he would do anything to make up for his mistakes.</p><p>However, Rosaline was not moved by his pleas and told him to leave. She said that she hated him and that he had no right to interfere in her life. She also said that she had moved on and that she was happy with Paris. She then ran away from him, leaving him alone and shattered.</p><p>What will happen in Chapter 45? Will Rosaline and Romeo ever reconcile? Will Paris find out about Romeo’s return and Rosaline’s past? Will Romeo give up on Rosaline or fight for her love? How will their son react to the truth about his father? These are some of the questions that fans are eager to find out in the next chapter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cast></span>Cast<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tr><th>Character</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody readability=15><tr readability=6><td>Rosaline</td><td>The female protagonist of the story.
