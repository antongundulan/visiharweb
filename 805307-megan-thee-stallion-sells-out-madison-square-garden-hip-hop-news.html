The Garden is one of the most iconic arenas in the entire world. The New York Knicks and the New York Rangers play there, and some iconic artists have had concerts at the venue. Well, as it turns out, Megan Thee Stallion was able to sell out Madison Square Garden. She celebrated this on Instagram, writing "Hotties I am really back here tearing up. We really got a SOLD OUT show at the most famous arena in the world&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">@thegarden</a>&nbsp;like huhhh???

Furthermore, it was revealed that Meg, GloRilla, and Cardi B would be dropping a remix of the song "Wanna Be." Needless to say, fans at the show were blessed with quite the performance.
