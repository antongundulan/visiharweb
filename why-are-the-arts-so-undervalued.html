The questions raised by the strike action, and the vast scale of them, are profoundly resonant to the arts in general and how much we value them – or don't. Because if we no longer ascribe any intrinsic worth to the people who have meticulously crafted what we read, watch and enjoy, what does that say about how highly we think of the arts in society?</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Master the Art: Jane Fonda on how to be an activist" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2020-11-12-at-07-38-00-1605166717.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I was younger, I wanted to be an actress. My parents were supportive but I got the impression that they wanted to prepare me for the less glamorous aspects of the job. They made me watch Fame and Withnail and I, and they only bought me the actor biographies which strenuously detailed a life of rejection and hardship. My mother cut out a comic strip for me, which remained pinned to the cork-board behind my desk until my early twenties when (spoiler alert) I gave up this dream. It showed a man knocking on his neighbour’s door. "I’m an actor and I’ve just moved in next door," he says. "Can I borrow a cup of money?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When we think of actors, we perhaps think of the Hollywood stars living a life of luxury, where <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/g42455333/golden-globes-2023-best-dressed/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Golden Globes" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Golden Globes</a> are displayed in their downstairs bathrooms and Architectural Digest pops over for house tours. But what the recent strikes make clear, is that these 'stars' are a slim minority. The overwhelming preponderance of those working in the arts – from writers to actors – are the kind who might move in next door to you, and ask for a cup of money. The sad fact is that, more than 20 years after my mother gave me that comic strip, this joke is still an accepted truism. If you work in the arts – be that as a singer, painter, writer or actor – don’t expect to make any money.</p><img alt="mandatory credit london entertainmentshutterstockmandatory credit photo by giles harrisonshutterstock 14097557fmargot robbie marches from netflix studios to paramount studios during a sagaftra rally in west hollywoodmargot robbie marches from netflix studios to paramount studios during a sagaftra rally in west hollywoodlifornia, usa 13 sep 2023" title="Margot Robbie marches from Netflix Studios to Paramount Studios during a SAG/AFTRA rally in West Hollywoodlifornia, USA - 13 Sep 2023" width=4186 height=6567 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/shutterstock-editorial-14097557f-6502ec24a9a4c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Giles Harrison/Shutterstock</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Shutterstock</span><p>Margot Robbie is among the many famous faces who have joined the picket lines in Hollywood</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When I was at school there was a really clear distinction made to me between working in a creative field and making money," says Mishki Vaccaro, a writer and director who currently works between Toronto and LA. "Obviously, I wanted to have the sort of financial freedom to live a good, comfortable life and to support myself. But if my motivating factor wasn't to make all the money in the world through business, then I felt, even at that age, that my point of view wasn't valued."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What Vaccaro explains is that a binary had been laid down between a job that would bring fulfilment to her life, and one which would financially remunerate her. It was as though she couldn't have both – and was, in fact, being punished for having the audacity to pursue a career she might enjoy. "But I would also argue that what I do has its own very important value in society, and I don’t understand why so many people in my industry are still underpaid or – worse – asked to do it for free," she says. "It shows just how much people actually value what we do, even as they consume it every day."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"We no longer ascribe any intrinsic worth to the people who have crafted what we consume"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The strikes pertinently occurred in a post-Covid era, after a pandemic in which the important function of art in society had never been more appreciated. What did we do at home for months, if not consume the work that people like Vaccaro had meticulously created? While we clapped for the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a43138632/nurse-doctors-nhs-strike-opinion/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="NHS workers" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">NHS workers</a> who kept us alive, there was also a quiet, unspoken but collectively recognised understanding that artists were also keeping us alive – in a different way. It was songs, books, films and TV shows that nurtured our spirits during those long months of panic and insecurity. It would make sense if both industries would see this renewed appreciation as a fiscal turning point. They did not and, ironically, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a43138632/nurse-doctors-nhs-strike-opinion/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="both are now striking" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">both are now striking</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think it is important to look at the value of the arts in light of this current wave of unionisation," says Sam Ladkin, senior lecturer in creative and critical writing at the University of Sussex and editor of the 2016 book, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Against-Value-Arts-Education-Disruptions/dp/178348490X data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Against Value in the Arts and Education" data-vars-ga-product-id=b87d7e36-a49f-42e4-9aa3-fa05e64e4a1b data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Against-Value-Arts-Education-Disruptions/dp/178348490X data-product-url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Against-Value-Arts-Education-Disruptions/dp/178348490X data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Against-Value-Arts-Education-Disruptions/dp/178348490X data-affiliate-network='{"site_id":"73f36449-646d-480d-bdba-369f484c6984","network":{"name":"Amazon"}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=fe0e53c0-b6ee-4aa7-9dda-664317b49eab class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Against Value in the Arts and Education</a>.

Art is, after all, a famously subjective medium. One man’s Picasso is another man’s trash. So, if you can’t really measure the merit of individual art itself, how can you track its broader impact?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Art is a victim of audit culture," he says. "By this I mean we are always trying to justify art by translating it into a different form of data. So, the ambiguity and the complexity of the arts and the experience of the arts gets reduced down to the kind of commodified things the consumer might buy." Art is, therefore, placed within a system that measures it by a yardstick that doesn’t quite apply. "What’s wrong with how we judge the arts is the fact that we believe something is justifiable only if it can be translated into money."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Art is a famously subjective medium – if you can’t measure its merit, how can you track its impact?"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ladkin compares this to the unpaid labour of caregivers (disproportionately women) whose work contributes to the smooth running of society but, because it cannot be quantitively measured, is not valued. Vaccaro sees this an equally gendered problem, as "arts and artistic pursuits are generally coded as feminine versus maths and science, which are coded as masculine". It goes some way to describe why <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/people-parties/bazaar-at-work/a28351376/what-its-really-like-kerrine-bryan/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="STEM subjects" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">STEM subjects</a> are foisted upon girls as a way to readdress the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/people-parties/bazaar-at-work/a43519573/gender-health-gap-at-work/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gender pay gap" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">gender pay gap</a>. While this is valiant, it fails to consider the fact that it's underpinned by a fundamentally flawed value judgement. Instead of recognising that the arts are outrageously underfunded and underpaid, we just push people away from them.</p><img alt="kristen stewart on set filming" title="Kristen stewart on set filming" width=4500 height=2999 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/shutterstock-editorial-10510331o-6514335d552cb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Logan White/Amazon/Kobal/Shutterstock</span><p>Kristen Stewart filming ’Seberg’ in 2019</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It shows that we do not value the things that are not quantitatively measurable," says Vacarro. "But we work in a qualitative field: we work in narrative, we work in storytelling, we work in research, we work in relationships. You can’t measure that in the same way, and so tragically we are seeing huge underfunding to arts education and arts programmes in the States and in the UK."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is why <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Arts Council England" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Arts Council England</a> – which aims to invest more than £467 million of public money from the government and an estimated £250 million from The National Lottery each year to help support the sector – does attempt to measure the value of the arts differently. "We strongly advocate for the value that investment in culture creates for England," their spokesperson tells me. "This includes producing research on the <a href=# title=https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/developing-creativity-and-culture/health-and-wellbeing data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/developing-creativity-and-culture/health-and-wellbeing&source=gmail&ust=1692289028344000&usg=AOvVaw1caD-S5Xaimzx9dAXvxi8G" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/developing-creativity-and-culture/health-and-wellbeing data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=social class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">social</a> and <a href=# title=https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/developing-creativity-and-culture/art-culture-and-economy data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/developing-creativity-and-culture/art-culture-and-economy&source=gmail&ust=1692289028344000&usg=AOvVaw04Lyp1YzRzdPGqYKij0LtA" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/developing-creativity-and-culture/art-culture-and-economy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=economic class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">economic</a> benefits of creativity and culture, and making the case for investment to the government and the public." Through their meticulously researched 'Let’s Create' plan, they look at something called 'creative health', which encourages us to see art in the context of health and wellbeing.

But pushes from the likes of Arts Council England and the visibility of the strikes in Hollywood might just force a broader cultural conversation about our fatal misunderstanding of its significance. Both Ladkin and Vaccaro are hopeful that the strikes will prove an eye-opener to the reality of life in the arts, especially thanks to the endorsement of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a44687421/hollywood-strikes-explainer/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="huge celebrity names on the picket lines" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">huge celebrity names on the picket lines</a>, and the postponement of major projects and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a44672381/emmys-2023-postponed/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="award ceremonies" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">award ceremonies</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Storytelling is our is our first language – from the first caveman paintings, through mythology, and now to where we are in this industry – and it remains the way we make sense of the world," says Vaccaro. "These strikes are a fight to preserve the humanity in storytelling and I’m hopeful that this will be a wake-up call to everyone; a reminder that the mark of an enlightened society is its ability to make art."</p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSwtrjTrqmeZZ6axLR7wG1rcWtoaYV5e9ahsGaZopp6tbTEZpirrKNiwLB51Kebnqqmlrm2scNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-the-richest-tiktoker-in-india.html><span>←</span><span>Who is the richest Tiktoker in India?</span></a>
