He never met his father as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he was killed</a> a month before he was born; a single mother brought him up. After his mother relocated due to work, he continued to live with his sister as his big brother was arrested and sentenced to 16 years in prison.</p><h2>What is 22Gz age?</h2><p class=align-left>As of 2020, the rap artist is 23 years old, as he was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born in the year 1997</a>. 22Gz birthday is on November 29, and he is a Sagittarius.</p><h2>22Gz murder charges</h2><p class=align-left>In 2017, the rapper made headlines after it was reported that he had been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">involved in a shooting</a>. A man identified as a 30-year-old father of one Ladarian Phillips died due to bullet wounds he sustained during the commotion.
