As she goes into labour, fans are placing their guesses on what she’ll name the baby.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/09/GettyImages-1189429293-821x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-trisha-paytas-prepares-for-labour>Trisha Paytas prepares for labour</h2><p>Trisha announced she is preparing for labour on Twitter, letting her followers know that she is 1cm dilated. It comes after she posted a photo to her Instagram two days ago, asking if it is the last week she will be pregnant.</p><p>The YouTuber <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>: “WE ARE SO BEYOND READY TO MEET OUR DAUGHTER.” At the latest, Trish’s induction date is set to be September 22nd, meaning her baby is due to be a Virgo child.</p><p>While she is 1cm dilated, this still means she may not give birth for weeks, but it could also signify just hours until labour, depending on the person’s body.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-guess-trisha-s-baby-name>Fans guess Trisha’s baby name</h2><p>The most popular guess is that Trisha will call her daughter Elizabeth in tribute to the Queen, who died on September 8th. Other guesses made by fans include Paisley and Malibu.</p><p>One fan wrote: “Is her name Elizabeth??? PLEASE BE ELIZABETH.”</p><p>Another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>: “I’m genuinely hoping Trisha Paytas would name her baby Elizabeth, I think that’ll be so iconic of her.”</p><p>Others think she could still name the baby after the royal family, such as Diana, Eli or Liz. “If I were Trisha Paytas I’d name my baby Elizabeth Alexandra to spice up the year just a little bit more,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">penned</a> a fan.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-youtuber-to-reveal-name-when-she-s-born>YouTuber to reveal name when she’s born</h2><p>Trisha said during a ‘baby name reveal’ video that they have already chosen a name for their daughter, which they will announce when she is here. She also said she is keeping it a secret while pregnant as “it’s more exciting to wait”.</p><p>The YouTuber revealed:</p><p>We have a baby name put down. The only reason we’re not saying is because, you know me, I’d love to blurt it, I’m not superstitious, but I want to announce her name when she’s here. If for whatever reason, we see her and think oh no, that’s not her name, I don’t foresee that happening. Ultimately we want to see her and have her in the world and have her energy when we introduce her.</p><p>She has revealed that both her and Moses will be raising their child without gender norms. According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Popbuzz</a>, the YouTuber will be bringing up their daughter as non-binary, but revealed she is a girl in April.</p><p>Before her body began getting ready for labour, Trisha and Moses set up a car seat for their baby, revealing in an August 10 video that she wants to be prepared before she arrives.</p><p>She revealed in the same video that she will not be talking about diet or weight, and will make sure the baby is active.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Trisha Paytas Hacmon (@trishapaytasbackup)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FACEBOOK</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TWITTER</a> AND <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TIKTOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfo7K4v46fmKerXZzCpr%2FSZquroaOdrm68wLKrmqtdmLWquMOsZKeZnZp6or%2BMrJ%2BeZaCnsrGt0Z6qZp6fp3qtrcGorKs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=next href=./774895-21-savage-looks-different-latto-hip-hop-news.html><span>21 Savage Looks Different In New Photos, Fans Think Latto Is Responsible</span><span>→</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
